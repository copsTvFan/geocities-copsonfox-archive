      Patrol) Officer Harry Jackson says this time of the year people come from
      all parts of the country, the Navy brings in a bunch of ships and
      prostitutes come from all across the country because business is up. He
      spots a young girl, Samantha Wilson, on the corner he knows and sees a guy
      pick her up. Harry asks where she’s coming from and she says it was
      Union, doesn't know the cross street. He says she should know the cross
      street by now. It's Jessup, she remembers. He sees money in her bra and
      she says it's her boobs, then admits it's $65. She says she knows the guy,
      he was giving her a ride and has known him for 6-7 months. Then she admits
      he was giving her $25 for a BJ, he's a regular on Sundays. Today is
      Sunday, he's usually off, but is sneaky and is working today. He goes over
      and questions Mr. Larkin to see what he says. He mirandizes him and says
      he knows she's doing business. He says he has the right to remain silent
      and it's his mom's car. He's 26, still living at home and has no
      registration, so Harry will call his parents to see if they know what he's
      up to. Larkin says he's known her six months, they met in January. He
      hasn't arrested Sam before, but has given her a hard time though. Larkin
      has never taken her home because his parents are always there. Harry says
      he has no problem doing it on the streets and can't take a nice lady home.
      Then he tells Sam to tell him what she told him. Harry says he went to
      school 2 blocks from there, he's lived there 45 years and wants to clean
      up the community. Harry says he'll throw money at her, but won't take her
      home to mom. (9:15 AM) Multnomah County Narcotics Task Force Briefing - Sgt.
      John Bunnell says it's going to be a long day, search warrant for heroin,
      4 cars, Pat will do photos, Danny will do evidence and to suit up. There
      is a calendar on the wall with women's butts in bathing suits. They run up
      to the house, John says they are too far away. The old woman asks what the
      hell are the doing there, where's the search warrant, it's not here. They
      tell her it is. John talks to Ron, he says he wants to make it easy, there
      is no heroin, just what he's using. He gets the heroin from Mike Williams.
      John says he knows where he gets it. He used to get it from Jerry, but
      he's in Las Vegas, on vacation. John calls Celeste in and arranges for Ron
      to call Mike to make a deal. He calls him from his car phone in the Camero
      to make a deal for 2 o'clock. (2:02 PM) Mike is an older white guy who
      walks up with his two kids, they bust him and he says not to scare his
      children. The boy says he goes to school half day, the girl says all day.
      Mike's been dealing 5-6 days, but never sold it before. He's shaking and
      John says they aren't playing games, answer the questions and sign the
      papers. Mike says he'll take them to it and give it to them. He lost his
      wife 2 years ago and wants them to tell the kids he's OK. He buys from
      Miguel in Hillsboro. They want him to call Miguel and set up a deal, but
      he doesn't want to lose his kids. The girl says her mom died when she was
      33 and is up with the angels now. John says sometimes that's a better
      place. They are going to Mike's house to get the heroin and have him call
      Miguel and start the game all over again. (4:15 PM) John says they can
      take everything of Mike's - his cars, house, everything. The car doesn’t
      interest them though, it doesn't meet their requirements. It's a nice old
      colonial house though. Mike limps around, says he lived there 11 years and
      is going to have to sell it. He takes him to the safe where the combo is
      right 3 times to 73. John opens it and asks, “it won't blow up in my
      face will it?” There is a bunch of money, some rocks, not much. Mike
      calls Jose to make a deal. John says he has to make a decision to take his
      kids to a foster home and is it the best things for the kids? They just
      lost their mom, maybe they'll take the kids for a little while to wake him
      up. John is upset and can't even count the money. It's a tough call. It's
      not the normal house of a heroin dealer. John asks Max the neighbor to
      watch the children while Mike is in jail for a few hours. (8:09 PM) John
      draws a diagram of the house where the main dealer is. They want to get
      everyone secured fast and then search the place. There are a couple
      Mexican guys who don't speak English and they find 2 guns. They also find
      a .30 caliber rifle and a gun under the mattress. The guy admits the dope
      is his and has a notebook with phone numbers and Mike is in it. They
      charge him with drugs, dealing and call immigration. #201. 9/23/89</td>

      County - Narcotics Task Force Briefing. Cops are in a parking lot and Sgt.
      John Bunnell says he'll knock and announce and Bob will use the shotgun
      because the suspect is armed. They pull up to the yellow house with the
      blue Chevelle in the driveway with Bunnell driving. They are going in fast
      and slam the door open and run in. Mike is taken down on a bed with a
      giant Harley flag on the wall. He makes lots of woo woo noises. They tell
      him to rest his head on the door panel, he doesn't want to tell them
      anything. They tear up his bed and pillows and find crystal meth and
      lots of .357 bullets. The meth tests positive. They finds tons of stolen
      property there. Bunnell wishes people would etch their license or social
      security number on their items to make them easy to ID. The garage is full
      of stolen VCRs, stereo equipment, cameras, car radios &amp; cable boxes. (2:15
      PM Stolen Property Returned) They found a mans name on some tools and call
      him. He arrives and says the tool drawer is his and he had 2 antique gold
      watches in there. Bunnell says they have bags of watches. One man shows up
      with serial numbers for his power saws. One man finds his stolen gun, but
      the holster isn't his. The guys mom pulls up and wonders what is going on.
      She says she knows nothing about what Mike did. Bunnell says it's hard to
      believe since it is all over the house. She doesn't know about the drugs
      either. Inside she says he paid for all this stuff. They found no
      paperwork and he didn't turn any over. Central District - Foot Patrol. Two
      officers walk through an area under an overpass and say they found body
      parts there and lots of people trying to hide. (9:45 AM) they go in to
      remove the homeless people who are doing drugs. Officer Barry Cook finds two Mexican
      guys living in a hole under a concrete slab. He has black tar heroin and
      they only speak Spanish and the one guy
      is all smiling and goofy. They arrest him and have arrested him before at
      least 10 times. He says the jacket he's wearing isn't his. Barry searches
      him and gets stuck with a needle. He frantically tries to push the blood
      out as fast as possible hoping he doesn't have AIDS. He puts the
      guy in his car and gets the first aid kit out of the trunk. He wipes down
      and cleans up with hand sanitizer. The other guy is booked on criminal
      trespass. Barry says he'll have to worry about it for the next 10 years.
      Back at the station he calls the clinic for information on the needle
      prick. They tell him the changes of getting AIDS are a couple 100 to 1,
      he's got a better chance of getting hepatitis, but he's gotten shots for
      that. It's an officers worst nightmare. Rose Festival Fun Center - Foot
      Patrol - two officers patrol at a carnival. They say that the less crime,
      the more likely people are to show up. Officer Mark Murawski spots a metalhead dancing idiotically with a bottle in his hand. He grabs the bottle and
      him and leads him away. No alcohol is allowed so he pours it out. Officers spot
      a black man with a large knife. They are ejecting him from the park and
      find two other knives on him. Officer Rick Hegrenes spots a mullet head
      with a Budweiser hiding in his Coke cup, he also gets banned from the
      park. They have to make an example of him. Back to the black guy, James,
      they find pot residue on him. He denies having enough to make residue, not
      even sure what it is. The officer laughs and just bans him from the park.
      Officer Frank Klejmont says they've had the fair since 1970 and people go
      nuts and act stupid. They exclude people from the park and they come back
      and get charged with trespassing. Officer Norman Sharp questions a guy
      with a concealed knife. The guy says he just came there for fun. He's not
      allowed there because he's drunk and has a weapon. They search another guy
      who won't tell them his last name and starts to get loud. They tell him to
      quiet down or else there'll be a problem. They stopped him because a bulge
      in his clothes might've been a gun. Two guys are drunk and fighting and a
      bunch of cops jump and arrest them. A third guy is busted for
      interference. He mouths off in the back of the paddy wagon and they pull
      them out and cuff him and he screams and bang the walls. #202. 9/30/89</td>

      County Sheriff's Dept. Narcotics Task Force warrant briefing. Sgt. John
      Bunnell has a map of a house interior drawn on a dry board. The
      neighborhood is in an uproar so they are going to show the flag. They are
      going to go in and do a normal entry since they bought drugs there before.
      They have testimony from CRI and Officer Biles that he's a belligerent
      weightlifter type, so they are going to take appropriate action. Bob will
      do the back bedroom and he'll follow with a key to get in whatever is
      locked. The job when they get upstairs is to grab people. Bunnell clears
      the upstairs and they find the old man who is the owner downstairs who
      fights them and won't go down. During the struggle his toupee comes off.
      There are 4 kids inside. Deputy Jerry Hill reads him the warrant that they
      have the right to search. Other officers wait outside to see if anyone
      else shows up. One of the kids inside is 16 and says he's visiting.
      Outside Bunnell stops a car with 17 year olds. The driver says he was just
      turning around. Bunnell says it's a lie and he'll take him in. He admits
      he was coming to the house to see who was there. The owner inside says he
      only served alcohol to his kids. There is alcohol out, but his kids aren't
      even there. He says his son is at the doctor. All the kids are 16 and just
      visiting. He says he wouldn't if he were them and they shouldn't be there.
      Jerry says this goes on every weekend. He says he was just off from work
      this night, it never happened before. Outside they pull a man out of a red
      truck at gunpoint. He's holding a bag and says it isn't his house. Deputy
      Lane Sawyer questions him inside and tells him that giving beer to minors
      is just as bad as giving them drugs and the neighborhood parents are
      upset. The son says he won't let anyone in from now on. If anyone else
      buys after tonight they are all going down. At the end cops tell a group
      of metal heads if they can run all the way off the street in 10 seconds
      they won't get busted. One kid has a Danzig shirt as they make a mad dash.
      A man calls 911 who says that the next time his female neighbor, Lynn,
      sees him talking to a cop she'll burn his house down. They go out to his
      house where the man repeats the story and has his two daughters there as
      witnesses. She cursed him out and fought with her boyfriend. The officer
      knows the woman, they know she has a drug problem. He won't have to go to
      court if he needs to avoid a problem. They go to a nearby bar and find the
      woman. She's a tiny, skinny skank who denies making threats. He says the
      first person they'll look for is her if they have a problem with him. He
      says they are tired of her. She says she's sick of them. He says he's
      never talked to her before, but arrested her when she was driving drunk
      doing 75mph down the road. She doesn't remember it because she was drunk.
      He says next time they'll just arrest her. She goes back in saying it's
      fine. (10:12 PM Return Call) A neighbor saw her back at the house with a
      Molotov cocktail. The man and the kids saw her. Cops say they need to sign
      a complaint and it's time to stop with the games, they need to arrest her.
      One of the girls cries. The man says he's going to have to move. The cop
      says he'll be out there 5 days a week for the next 7 years so he'll take
      care of it. Two female witnesses saw her too, they say she's dangerous and
      there are kids around. They find the woman walking down the road in a red
      bathing suit and arrest her for attempted arson. She mouths off and says
      she'll talk to the judge. They say to also charge her with reckless
      endangerment and trespassing to keep her in jail longer. She curses them
      out. He asks if she knows how serious this is. She says she isn't going to
      start fires and she didn't go over there. She's drunk again and they says
      that's the problem. The man wants to know how long she'll stay in jail, he
      has to think of his daughters. He wonders if she'll get her drug friends
      to come after him. The cop can't guarantee that won't happen, but he's
      going to arrest her every time. Bureau of Police. North Precinct Street
      Patrol - Officer Harry Jackson questions some girls, then stops. (4:30 PM)
      he talks to a black girl Dominica, on the corner and asks her why she was
      getting in the car. She says she needed a ride. Harry asks her where she
      was going. She doesn't give a real answer. They question the old white
      male driver about what happened. He says she was hitchhiking and needed a
      ride. She asked him if he was a cop and wanted him to turn around and go a
      different way. He said no and wanted her to get out and she grabbed the
      keys. Harry says he's been working this area for the last 2 1/2 years and
      what she does is have them go around back, get their pants off and her
      boyfriend jumps out of the bushes with a gun and robs them. (5:10 PM) He
      stops and talks to a white girl on the corner. Harry says she has a
      different pimp. She says Kevin is the same guy. He's a black guy and he
      walks away and pulls his pants off. He says they rode around before with
      her after the guy got her pregnant and beat her. She had her chance to get
      out of the life, but has come back. He tried to help her and now will
      arrest her. She says she is still there because her mom won't take her
      baby and he doesn't want it. Harry says he'll take the kid if she stays
      there. She says she'll prove him wrong. He says the baby can't make the
      choice. (5:16 PM) She is walking with Kevin and he stops him for pulling
      his pants down before. He says he didn't do it and doesn't want to go to
      jail, he was pulling his pants up. He apologizes and says the girl is his
      wife, she says no. He says soon to be and they are going to his moms
      house. Harry didn't see him pull his pants down so he lets them go, next
      time if he sees it he'll arrest him. It's a hard life, nobody says it
      would be easy. #203. 10/7/89</td>

      explain about surveillance they have on a business in the southeast. They
      have a warrant on the business and the house and have Bob now on a traffic
      stop in a blue Camero. John says he won't cooperate. They talk to Bob
      Park, who has his kid with him. Lane tells him he works narcotics and has
      been watching him sell coke. He can say nothing if he wants, but Lane can
      go full bore on him, if he finds enough he can go federal and Bob can get
      10 years. Bob says he isn't the guy, they should know who he is getting it
      from. Lane says he might know who he is, but needs his cooperation. They
      check his trunk, it's filled up by a large speaker. They find a shotgun
      inside and he says it doesn't work and is old. There is a handgun in the
      front, but no dope in the car. He has a wad of cash on him. (1:15 PM) They
      take him back to a hotel and have him make a call to his buyer. He wants a
      half and tells her to be careful. John tells him they will set the call up

      her. John tells her to be very cooperative. She says she will. John says
      if she is truthful she can stay home, if she jerks them around, she'll be
      going to jail. In the back they find a drug scale and bags of coke. The
      women says they are not heavily involved in coke sales, the maximum she
      sells to is to 10 people a day, not $1000s a day. John asks where she got
      the coke. She says a guy named Mike. John asks what would happen if she
      called him. She calls to make a meet for an ounce. John sets up a meeting
      - it never ends.(2:27 PM) John says the guy is en route. When he shows up,
      grab them both and he'll meet with Lane. The guy shows up in blue and
      black shorts. He and a woman go up to the house. Once they go inside the
      cops run to the house. The girl has a cigarette in a death grip as they
      cuff her and take her out. They ask Mike where he gets it from. He says
      the guy they busted, Bob Park. Lane asks where he is. He says he doesn't
      know directly, but he'll make a deal (9:45 PM) They set up a meeting with
      Bob at a car wash. They jump him and he growls and says OK. John yells at
      him that they told him not to screw around and he learned his lesson. He
      has a bag of dope and a couple bags in the van. Bob gets a bloody lip in
      the struggle. John says he wants to search his van and apartment. Bob says
      there is nothing, same as last time, he wants to talk to his lawyer, then
      says to go ahead and look. The van is gross, covered in filth. John says
      it's 2:30 AM, it took 12 hours and 2 arrests later they are still going.

      west.&quot; (Street Patrol) Portland North Precinct - Officer Becky Wooten
      takes the call of a stolen bike that comes in to 911. She says a
      neighborhood boy stole it yesterday, she got it back, but now she doesn't
      want to mess with. She goes to the house, talks to the mom, says he did it
      before, but doesn't know the house where the bike belongs to. Becky has
      been there before and says if he comes back to call them and they'll take
      it. Call even if he doesn't have the bike. Kevin is a young black kid in a
      Nike soccer shirt who comes walking up. She cuffs him, says he's going to
      jail and he cries. She mirandizes him and puts him in the back of the
      police car until he calms down. She says she talked to his mom, she knows.

      tell him to. He'll be the one that goes to jail.. She tells him she'll
      think about taking the cuffs off. She closes the door on h m and leaves
      him there. Becky tells the mom she doesn't want him to know there isn't
      much that they can do to him. She keeps him back there and drives to a
      house looking for Milton. Becky goes to Milton's house on 18th, says he
      stole 2 bikes and took them apart. Mom goes in and finds Milton, he says

      with him or go to his house anymore. They dare each other to steal. Becky
      says if they hang out together she’ll arrest them both for whatever
      crime the one does. Milton asks if he's going to the judge and he'll be
      good. Becky says she isn't unarresting him, just giving him to the custody
      of his mom and the paperwork is on it's way. She takes him home and if it

      Harry Jackson is #578 and patrols an area with prostitutes. He stops to
      talk to two of them on Stafford and Union. The young girl says she is 18,
      Harry says no. She says her birthday is 8/26 and that he knows her. The
      older woman tells her to shut up and answer the questions and she's going
      to get a 40, some Taco Bell and going home to eat. He asks why was she
      talking to a man in a car then. She claims it was her boyfriend and he
      doesn't buy it. The young girl turns out to be 15 years old and again says
      he knows her. He says he talks to 25 girls a night and doesn’t remember
      their names unless he arrests them a bunch of time. She curses a few times
      so he arrests her. She says her mom is dead and the older one tells her to
      shut up. Harry wants to see her shoes and see if the older one has
      warrants. She just met her, didn't know she was 15, was with a friend and
      he can ask her. The 15 year old tries to get out the other side of his
      police car and he puts her back in. The older says she was with a retarded
      dude and is going to get him some tacos because he has nothing to eat. He
      asks if she is going to be back on the street. She says hell no, it'll
      take 15 minutes. He checks the 15 year olds’ purse, finds condoms and
      wants to contact her parents to see if they know what she's doing out
      there everyday. He calls for a female officer because she crawls out of
      the car, up on the roof, her dress goes up and she curses out the
      cameraman for 10 seconds street. She's totally high and it takes a few
      cops to calm her down. Harry gives her to a female to transport her to
      juvenile. She fights, rolls, struggles, screams, says get off of me and
      they throw her in the back of car where she yells at them. Harry can't
      believe how strong she is. (Narcotics Task Force Buy-Bust Briefing)

      rid of. Special Agent Celeste Cowan is going in and he tells her to be
      calm, like she wants to party. Talk if you must, ask for coca or cheva. If
      they want to take them somewhere, take off across from the Bomber. The
      girls use a red corvette to make the buy as John watches from across the
      street hoping they can do this in one shot. The guys see them and approach
      and the girls make a buy for $200. It's their second buy of black tar.

      pound, but to pay for half of it now, half later. Don't front the money,
      it doesn't leave the car or else they'll be working parking patrol in
      Butte Montana and they laugh. Celeste goes up to the house smoking as kids
      are around. John hopes she doesn't give the bust signal because he needs
      to see more of it. She asks to see a pound. John gets nervous she is going
      to blow it. The drugs are at the sister's unit where the little girl is,
      she's the drug runner. She counts it out, that's the bust signal.
      Undercover and uniformed cops pour into the first unit. John says he won't
      take the kids if she shows them where the rest of the dope is. If she
      won't tell then kids are gone. The woman agrees and leads them around back
      and the kids try to go in too. She goes into the room and then acts like
      she doesn't know what they want. They explain it’s drugs and guns. John
      finds a sack with 10 big bags of black tar, $250,000 - $300,000 worth.

      they need you more. The 12 year old was taken first, before they got
      there, they called, she is OK. They were out garage sale shopping and
      found clothes in the car. Loren asks him if he has someone to drive him or

      weapons are involved. He gets there and talks to a couple of guys on the
      street who say the kid is over there under a car. Then Chris drives as
      they stand on the car two blocks looking for the kid. Mom says she has no
      idea why he's like this. Chris asks if he's on drugs. She says no, he
      flipped out ever since his dad went to jail. (9:22 PM) He's still chasing
      the kid and wants to arrest him for assault for beating up his mom. They
      finally catch him and a bunch of cops grab him. He has a long mullet and
      says they are hurting him and calls for his mom. His mom is right there
      and doesn't want them to arrest him. Chris yells at her not to call the
      police if she doesn't want their help. In jail he says he didn't run,
      didn't resist arrest and didn't know he was under arrest. He asks why do
      they think they were chasing him. (Neighborhood Dispute) Dennis says his
      kids saw a boy named Mike shooting a BB gun last week and then today the
      window on his truck was shot out. Chris goes over there and the dad says
      no one saw him do it. Mike says he has a BB gun and shoots it in the
      backyard, not at his house. He might've shot a tree, it bounced off and
      broke his window. Dad offered to pay for it and went to talk to him. The
      wife says he refused to pay for it and it's not true, that's why the
      police are here. He tried to plead with Dennis to pay for it and he
      declined. It's the wife. Chris says Mike admitted breaking it and they
      should pay. He says he tried. Dennis says he wants them to take the BB gun
      away. Chris says they are all nice about it and Mike has probably learned
      his lesson. It’s going to be a long, hot summer and they need to get
      along. (Tactical Detail 6:45 AM) Det Sgt. Tom Seipert says the car is the
      deal today, V1 is primary, V2 is stolen and has been gone a few days. They
      have mugshots of James E. Whipple. He was arrested for burglary a week ago
      and drives like crazy. If they corner him he'll get spooked and dump the

      in a brown car, go into a pawn shop and come back with beer. (8:35 AM)

      and get two guys and a girl on the floor. James is in the basement. He
      says he won't make any moves and has no weapons. Then they find another
      guy and take James outside to search him. He gets unauthorized use of a
      vehicle, two counts of auto theft and two counts against Stanley. He says
      they followed him around a couple days, so why did they allow him to
      continue, if he was breaking the law? So they could get him with bigger
      crimes. He says yes, but he makes it sound like he encouraged him to break
      the law. He didn't suggest he break the laws, he did it on his own. North

      felony warrants running through a lot. She goes through huge bushes to get
      to the guy. He's a wild looking black guy with no shirt, says it's police

      follow him. They say his mom's in jail and to get in the car. He asks why,
      because he's a chump? They have to clean up because of the bushes and the
      guy does drugs. (911 Call Domestic Violence) A woman calls that a man has

      both sides of his head. She then cries. Ed tells her to take a break. She
      smokes and says she thinks Preston said, &quot;you're next you son of a
      bitch&quot; and pointed it at Gene. Gene's chair went back on the gravel,

      was too much trouble. He never threatened him before, but he threatened
      Paul saying he was going to shoot him. He doesn't own a gun, never has,
      never told Preston he owned a gun. Why would he say that? He doesn't know.

      her. They arrest him for being under the influence. At jail they read him
      his rights. (3:50 PM Traffic Stop) The guy says he has 3 deadly diseases -
      asthma, pneumonia and emphysema. He's like an older, grosser, dirty
      Charlie Manson who lives out of his car. He’s trying to get some sleep,
      trying to get some rest and is tired and sick. His car is filled with
      junk. He doesn't go to the hospital because he can't afford it. John says
      he should take up opportunities with the state for help instead of
      sleeping out there where tourists go. It's an old green car with a truck
      camper on the roof. He gets the car started and drives off. John says some
      people get stranded there with no money and they help them as best as they
      can. (Northern Division Street Patrol) Deputy Bill Hubler says they are
      going to have computers put in all the cars and will cut down paperwork by
      50%. He is told not to take the car past 5gs. He says that would be 500mph
      and he would die, but his computer would survive. He drinks 7-11 coffee on
      the run. (3:12 PM Stolen Vehicle Call) A man had his truck stolen a week
      ago and a friend found it by the railroad tracks. He called the cops to go
      over there. It's totally stripped, the wheels are gone, the bed of the
      truck was removed and is in a yard, plus the stereo and seats are gone.
      They go over and the hood it up, but the plates are still on it. They go
      up to the house and Maureen Masonette comes out. She says her son lives
      there with her, she was just cooking and they surprised her. Rajee the son
      comes out and says Greg from down the street was driving it got stuck in
      the mud and left it there. He doesn't know Greg’s last name. Bill says
      he better think fast. They stripped it and he took the bed off because the
      guy wanted the bed for his truck. Bill asks if he thinks a 1988 Toyota
      truck would get stuck and left there forever. He says he doesn't have any
      way to contact the police. He's arrested for possession of stolen
      property. They tell the owner the guy was the one tearing the stuff off
      his truck and he has no theft insurance. (5:48 PM) Bill talks to Rajee at
      the station. He wants the truth on everything or he will go to juvenile
      hall and his mom won't come and get him. They let him go and the mom says
      thanks, Bill suggests a major change in friends. The owner says it's
      disappointing and tires to salvage what he can. #216. 1/13/90</td>

      driver Mrs. Anderson has over $9000 worth of traffic warrants and her
      license is suspend. The passenger Mr. Burton is sucking a lollipop and has
      no license either. She is pulled out and has no pockets to search and says
      she knows why she's getting arrested then yells “What?” really loud.
      He says the tape case and magazines are his and wants to know why they got
      pulled over. No front license plate. She starts crying in the back. He is
      free to go so he grabs his stuff and walks away. Bill finds an exacto
      knife kit in a wooden box, a vial of meth inside, a butane pencil torch
      and a glass crack pipe. She used to be a model and they find a folder of
      glamour shots of her posing in lingerie. Bill says she used to be a pretty
      good looking and she's not anymore. Central Jail - Sgt. Grant Burnett says
      the advisory committee on adult detentions will be inspecting them, so
      make sure they polished their shoes, get a haircut and are squared away.
      He reads off the assignment list for search, P&amp;R, etc. and they head
      out. (3:40 PM) Deputy Gene Bursch is assigned to gate duty. The first guy
      gets one chance to go along with the program. They'll take the cuffs off
      and if he sits in the room for 4-6 hours he'll get no charges, if not he
      gets a padded room for 12 hours. They hand out bags to put possessions in.
      (4:45 PM) They ask the guy if he ever wanted to kill himself, he says yes,
      but not tonight. He's been charged with oral copulation and sodomy,
      $60,000 bail. He'll get a chance to post it, but most likely won't be able
      to. (6:20 PM) A man says they picked him up at the YWCA and they tell him
      to be quiet and he'll get out in a few hours. He wants to know something.
      They tell them they don't know anything. He says they are the f--king
      police, they should know. He and his pregnant old lady have been all over
      the US with no problem. They say he should stay out of San Diego. They
      search a guy on crystal meth. They can get violent, paranoid and attack
      because they think people are out to get them, especially the druggies. He
      says he slammed and shows where he did it. He sticks it in the breasts of
      a woman on a tattoo. His heart rate is 104 bpm, he says he's not using
      though. It's instant exercise. They look in the drunk tank and people are
      whooping it up. One guy spits on the door. Another guy, Wayne, says he
      hasn't done meth in a week. They say he's tweaking and lying. They put him
      in a padded room and he says &quot;Why me?&quot; They smell pot and a
      small Mexican and a black guy in the drunk tank are smoking it. They pull
      them out and search them. The joys of alcohol, a typical Friday night.
      (7:38 PM) Eddie the transvestite is brought in, he's a regular and is
      wearing a tube top, white hat and looks like a cross between Vince Neil
      and Cher. He is charged with possession. They check his arms and he has a
      huge scar where he shot up at 3pm. He says he'll be out in a few hours,
      maybe more since he looks so cute. They show guys inspected naked in the
      shower. William is brought in for being drunk. He's down on the floor and
      says he can get up. He's the Duncan Man and not turn his arm and hurt.
      Gene tells him to shut up. He won't open his mouth or follow the program.
      Gene says he's not going to make it. Eddie is fingerprinted. An old black
      drunk is let out, free again. He says maybe he drinks too much and maybe
      he belongs in jail. They say they'll see him tomorrow, he says maybe later
      tonight. Bill says all he had was a couple of beers. He has a bloody fat
      lip and was beat up. They go to inspect him and he fights and goes down.
      Three cops are on him and he starts screaming like a girl. They tell him
      he's heading for the rubber room. He keeps howling and says he'll
      cooperate. He leaves a big bloody spot on the wall. He says the cuffs are
      hurting him, but they can't take them off because he's fighting. He says
      he isn't fighting. (9:07 PM) A guy in solitary tried to kill himself by
      wrapping toilet paper around his chest and setting on fire. Gene asks why
      he did that. He says so he could get pain killers. Gene says it'll hurt
      twice as much with the burns. A Mexican drunk is brought in and wants to
      go home. Gene says to click his heels together three times and say, “there's
      no place like home.” They guy actually does it and Gene says drunks are
      so funny. They say goodbye to Eddie and they'll see him next week. Welcome

      assumed from the results alone that the patient has AIDS. He says that is
      correct. Can he assume from the Smith Klein test that he will get AIDS. He
      can say for certain, but everything they know says it is a great chance he
      will get full blown AIDS. Det. Brown is next up. He first saw him in the
      West Hollywood jail and interviewed him there. Did AIDS come up? He
      initiated it. He told him what happened on the arrest and he asked him if
      he had AIDS. He said he knew 6 weeks ago he had AIDS. He asked him why he
      was still soliciting if he knew this. He doesn’t care about anyone else
      and hopes they will all get it. As a result of the preliminary hearing the
      suspect was charged with felony prostitution. The case was later dismissed

      him at the gate and had three bags for the baby. He didn't have his key,
      got mad, hit her in the chest and tried to pull her wedding ring off.
      David says they'll have to go back since it's the city of Paramount and
      get a cop from there. She's working two jobs to take care of the kid, he's
      not giving her any help and is being a rudie-poo. She went to drop the kid
      off because it's his turn for visitation and she needs to go to work. They
      go to the Todds' house and yell to open up or they'll bring the K-9 up. He
      doesn't answer. David kicks at the door over and over, but the dead bolt
      holds it. They yell for Todd to come out. They let Chubby kick it a while.
      Eventually they get in and the dog goes through, but they don't find him.
      The paramedics are called for her because her arm is swelling up, her ribs
      might be broken and she's thrilled. They cart her off and say he's
      arrestible now. (6:17 PM) They get a call from Todd asking why his door
      was kicked in so they go back to his place. There are a few people inside
      and they ask where Todd Weiss is. He says he didn't touch his wife, never
      in his life. They have to go with the evidence they have and see. Bail is
      $5,000 since it's a felony if his friends want to bail him out. They've
      arrested him for it before. The law is that if there is any signs of
      injury they have to arrest and everyone is happy, except for him. Temple
      City Sheriff's Station (911 Call Domestic Violence) Deputy Patrick
      Martinez gets ready for work at the station. He says he and Rice are
      working out the schedule for some reasonable hours. Deputy Ann Brannan
      goes to a locker and grabs a shotgun. (7:20 PM) She goes to a call at 3642
      North Delta of a mother vs. daughter. The daughter says mom has been
      drinking all day, has no right to, passed out on the couch, she called her
      aunt and they kicked her out. She went to grandmas, kept drinking, punched
      her sister and bit her breast. She doesn't want to prosecute and her
      little daughter is crying. There are four of them living there. She has a
      black eye from mom, wishes she would go to jail, when is she going to stop
      drinking? If she wants to prosecute, they both have injuries so she'll
      have to make a citizen's arrest, they'll both go to jail and they'll have
      to take the kids. Mom went to AA, but Ann says she can't solve family
      drinking problems. She asks the girl if she has a place to go with her
      kid. Mom says she bit her chest and Ann looks. The little girl is cold and
      Ann checks her for bruises. She says they all need counseling or they can
      go to jail. #221. 2/17/90</td>

      Sheriff's Dept. Homicide Bureau - Sgt. Ray Verdugo says they are seeing a
      lot of homicides, a vast increase. Last year was a record-breaking year in
      the entire county and this year they are ahead of last year. There seems
      to be an underlying sense of frustration and anger unleashing real
      rapidly, people seem to have a shorter fuse and are more angry about
      lesser things. The wrong look will kill you. He often sees it as fame or
      infamy. If you can't be famous, be infamous - try to assassinate the
      president. Be known in your own crowd as the meanest guy or the guy who
      shot and killed someone. It's a tragedy. If he had the job and the
      education maybe he could give you the answer why. On patrol he says it is
      a warm, beautiful night, very comfortable, one of those unfortunate things
      that brings people to southern California. There is a murder in the
      Fireside station on Hopper in South Central. Detective Dave Castillo and
      Deputy Tanya Edwards are on scene. She says the guy and his 6 buddies were
      dancing and having a ball with their shirts off. Then 8 guys came up to
      them and told them to put their shirts back on which they refused and a
      fight ensued between all 14 of them. One guy pulled out a semi-automatic,
      then another came out. One is DOA and there are 7 injured. The mans body
      is in the street and they take pictures. His sister ID's the body. Several
      witnesses come forward to talk to them including people involved and
      hopefully the suspect, but it's a pipe dream. He's an 18-19 year old
      youthful looking guy shot dead in the street for no reason. He took off
      his shirt, was dancing at a party and someone took offense and shot him
      dead. It's ludicrous, but a sign of the times. A guy at the station says
      the shooter fired 3-4 shots at Marco. Another witness says in Mexico quite
      often they take a stand of revenge. If someone kills a good person, they
      seek revenge to kill them. He is only 15, but would kill him if he had a
      gun. A man is killed and a cousin will hunt them down. They don't judge,
      but if they apply customs from another land, this person will get justice
      if they don't get him first. Some friend or relative will get him. If he
      goes back to Mexico, they will kill him. (2:45 PM) South East County -
      Sheriff's Station (911 Call Choking Child) Deputy David Halm takes the
      call of a baby having a seizure inside a supermarket. An employee has her,
      but doesn't know what to do. He takes the girl and puts her on the ground.
      Emily is breathing, that's good. He tells her to stay awake, don't close
      your eyes. Fire rescue arrives. Her heart is beating, no pupil reaction
      and she's been sick. They give her oxygen, the mom is crying and they tell
      her to be calm so the girl doesn't see her and freakout. They put her on a
      stretcher. (5:20 PM Warrant Briefing) LA County - Detective Armando Rea
      says it's a who dunnit case. A man was on his roof and saw a neighbor at
      2163 Briarcrest with his power tools that were stolen. (5:35 PM Warrant
      Served) They go to the house and pull out two men, a woman and two girls.
      The girl says her dad Mike went to a storage yard. In the garage they find
      a bicycle, weed eater, two heaters, an American toolbox and Christmas
      lights that were stolen. The victim arrives and carts his stuff out never
      thinking he would get it back. His grandma gave him the lights. He was in
      San Diego while his house was being fumigated and he was robbed. The wife
      has no idea what's going on, no idea about any stolen equipment. Then Mike
      pulls up and she screams like she's being killed and yells
      &quot;No!!!&quot; They pull out guns and make him stop. He surrenders and
      is cuffed. They got them all, it was a good stop. West Hollywood Sheriff's
      Station - Deputy Sean Collinsworth goes to a cleaner during a full moon
      wearing a large nose and glasses for Halloween. The cleaning will be ready
      Friday. He says the glasses tickle. (12:17 AM Street Patrol) Sean wants to
      get a picture of Deputy Paul Terrusa with a guy dressed as a zombie in the
      street. They both get pictures with a man as a silver robot. A man as a
      French maid cleans them. They get shows by scantily clad women to the
      delight of the crowd (911 Suicide Attempt) A guy tried to kill himself.
      They arrive and a woman says he just went down…the elevator. She has
      blood on her arm from him. They go downstairs and she runs out the door
      barefoot. They come around the corner to a shirtless, white long-haired
      guy who cut his wrist. He has no knife and says he's unhappy. Sean asks
      about anything particular. They call the Fire Dept saying he's on first
      floor in the back. Sean eats an apple while talking to him and is totally
      unphased. The guy has dozens of bracelets on and wants to go home, but
      they have to take him to the hospital. He says they have other business
      and should leave. He gets a little bit bummed out in life like they all
      do. (2:20 AM 911 Call Man with a Gun) They go to Jeff who says he
      overheard on the intercom that they were coming in from all corners Sean
      asks Jeff if he's on medication or under treatment. He says no. They don't
      see anyone coming at him. He says a woman walked out of her apartment with
      her dog. There was a figure in the front corner of the apartment, he has
      his left arm up right now. His finger was pointing at them, he had a gun
      and they zoomed in on all fours. He heard the man call in, he said
      homosexuality had to be stopped at all costs. It was pretty aggressive.
      Sean says it all looks normal to him. He says they split right before they
      came in a car. There's nothing they can do now, call us again if you see
      them. #222. 2/24/90</td>

      Homicide Bureau) A call comes in for two units to respond to a multiple
      murder shooting of three people at Direct Liquor. A witness says four
      people got shot. He just waited on the victims, they are dead face down in
      the street. He's been working there since 1965 and this is the worst thing
      he's ever seen. Sgt. Rey Verdguo arrives and Deputy Dana Villander
      explains what happened. Two kids came up, words were exchanged and the
      shooting started. A guy and a girl went down outside and were DOA. All the
      shots were fired outside. Two Mexicans were hit inside, probably dead, now
      removed. The witness was working there behind the counter and couldn't
      hear outside, but everyone started leaving and he saw what was happening.
      The guy inside said, &quot;Piru&quot; and they asked why he said that. He
      went outside, was hit, came back in and fell down. It's a gang fight
      between B13 and G13 Gardena 13 gangs. Two Mexicans pulled up and they told
      him they don't bang. They got shot at and two customers were hit on the
      way out. (1:56 AM Homicide Bureau) Detective Jerry Jensen questions
      Sherry, a black woman with a huge afro. She was walking out, they were
      walking in and they bumped into her boy and he asked what was going on. A
      guy pulled a gun, he called him blood and that was it, he had blood in his
      eyes. She is trying to remember how he looked, he had a baby face,
      possibly a thin mustache and thinks she can ID him. Lennox Sheriff's
      Station - Rey says this is a definite hit from a guy in the South Los
      Gang. (3:12 PM Homicide Investigation) Three out of the four have now
      died. They went to the location looking for a Gardena 13 gang member. It's
      what the one guy said that caused them to open up. What they do know is to
      talk to kids congregating and see what they heard. (Field Investigation)
      Two guys say Little Wolfie died and his brother Wolfie went back for
      justice. They don't know who this guy is. (4:02 PM Crime Lab) They remove
      a large slug from the dead black female. They have two bullets they want
      analyzed from a Rossi Revolver, Astra, Colt, or Dan Wesson. (10:11 Monday)
      They went to the house and retrieved some guns. (1:25 PM Ballistic Lab)
      One of the guns is a Wesson. They say the gun has no prints, but
      ballisticaly it matches up. They went to the G13 gang and they said
      Osvaldo Renrossos AKA Little Wolfie did it in retaliation for his
      brother's death. Ignacio Morina was only 13 and was going to join the gang
      and idolized Little Wolfie. They got photos and took it to their three
      witnesses. The woman ID's him right away and so does another witness. A
      member of B13 said that night he saw the shooter. He wasn't going to help
      him and off the record he said it was Wolfie. (One Month Later Suspect
      Arrested) They pulled by his house, saw his car there, went up to his
      mother and got him with no problems. In the station there is a Robocop
      poster on the wall. Rey tells the guy he has rights. He says he didn't do
      it, but knows about it. Rey said they will verify his story one way of the
      other and they want to be sure of a murder filing. It's multiple murders
      with the death penalty attached. He denies it, but all the witnesses say
      he did it. It's him beyond a reasonable doubt. Narcotic Bureau Temple City

      Attack) South East County Sheriff’s Station - Deputy David Halm says a
      woman isn’t breathing on Compton Blvd. It’s trailer #2. EMS arrives,
      but they can’t get in the door. They hear someone screaming inside.
      David slams the sliding glass door with his Billy club and a woman
      screams. He tells her to open the door, it’s the police and is someone
      is having a heart attack. She says she is now. He’s glad the glass didn’t
      break. The old white woman says she didn’t call. She was watching TV
      until 9pm and went to bed. EMS checks her out, 140/100 blood pressure. She
      asks if that’s high. They say considering, it’s pretty good. It seems
      a kid called it in, so it was a just cruel joke. She thanks them. (911
      Call Drunk and Disorderly) They stop a white guy in a cowboy hat next to a
      white car. He says he has a license and shows it to David’s partner. The
      guy says he has had something to drink and thinks about it – a bottle of
      beer and 3 mixed drinks. He has a Budweiser shirt and sounds totally
      drunk. Where is he headed? He’s not sure, he’s going to his basement
      apartment around the corner. He says he wasn’t going to drive. They tell
      him he better not. He says it won’t happen. He was inside a fast food
      place and was drunk. No one saw him drive, he says he wasn’t driving, so
      there is nothing they can do. Minutes later they swing around after
      getting a call that he drove away. If they find him they’ll arrest him.
      They spot his car around the corner swerving down the road. He hits a curb
      and stops. Dan told him not to drive. He pulls him out, says he has no
      weapons and gives him a field sobriety test. The guy says he doesn’t
      know if he can, the ground isn’t level. They take him to a paved lot and
      have him walk a straight line, which he can’t do. They arrest him, take
      him to the station and give him a breath test. It comes out .202 - double
      the legal limit. They put him in a cell. The breath is always lower than
      the blood would be so he probably has a .22 or .23. (7:20 AM Warrant
      Briefing) Antelope Valley Narcotic Bureau – Deputy Dennis Ingersoll says
      they want a lightweight meth dealer, male white, 30 years old and the
      informant says he carries 9mm. Tony takes the back, Carl takes the bolt

      a search warrant. They cuff the other guy too. One cop finds a bunch of ¼
      grams of meth wrapped in papers. They bring the guy with no shirt into the
      kitchen. They hear he’s dealing and he was found sleeping next to it. He
      says it’s not his. They bring Wayne in the kitchen and ask where the
      stash is so they don’t have to tear the house apart. He says he doesn’t
      have a stash and doesn’t deal. He’s told an undercover bought from him
      personally two days ago. Now he wants to lie to him, he didn’t just fall
      of the turnip truck. Wayne says he doesn’t want his house torn up, but
      he has no stash. They’ll tear up every inch of the place until they find
      it, how are they supposed to trust him? In a woman’s purse they find an

      EMS works on him, gives him oxygen and he’s not happy about getting a
      needle. They say he was just shot, a needle is the least of his worries.
      Deputy Bruce Vallerand talks to a witness. The guy says it looked like
      .32s. One was a .38 and the passenger shot him. They are a couple of drug
      dealers. The big guy got shot twice, the skinny guy shot once, neither are
      going to die, but it’s definitely gang related. (4:37 PM Disturbance

      wanted to change the hat. He goes to Cal State, bought a bunch of stuff,
      went to wear the hat to the basketball game, took it out and saw it was
      all worn. He came to get his money back and she said no, it’s been worn.
      The cop says to give him another hat and they can all leave. They want to
      give him the money back, but he doesn’t want it, he wants the Chicago
      Bulls hat. They pull it down from a display and he says it’s fine. Robin
      says they come over to this country and try to make a living. The only way
      they can survive it to keep it open 20 hours a day from 6am to 2am. There
      was a communication breakdown and they think they are getting ripped off,

      test. He has trouble closing his eyes and putting his head back. Then he

      more than a second. He says it’s the first time he’s done this. Sean
      then demonstrates the heel to toe straight line and he messes up the
      count. The guy says he’s the cop, he can let him do it over. The guy can’t
      even put his heels together. Sean says he passed the last test, he’s
      under arrest and cuffs him. They find a huge machete in the car and the

      him to start walking home. He keeps mouthing off, says he knows his rights

      because he's been sick. David says when they get too hot they can have a
      seizure to fight the heat. They take the baby's clothes off. EMS arrives
      and the mother says she started giving the baby penicillin on her own.
      They say she shouldn't do that. David assures them this is normal for a
      baby. He thanks them and leaves. (9:33 PM Domestic Dispute) David knows
      the guy, he's on parole and has dealt with him before. The guy tries to go
      inside and David makes him comes back. They live behind a fenced gas
      station/convenience store and their fence is covered with beer ads. The
      guy says Tina took all his stuff, his car and furniture. She says she
      wants to get her bed and kitchen table and has a friend with her that has
      a truck to haul it out. She doesn’t want a fight, but he keeps yelling
      and carrying on. He says she's leaving him with an empty house. Tina says
      her sister is getting married so she has to do it know. He wants her to

      spread out. There are a bunch of sheds and camper tops from trailers and
      they find a guy and a woman in a wooden box. Another guy comes out and
      they give her the warrant to search the place. There is a sign that reads
      “Attack cat on duty.” The only way to get into their &quot;house&quot;
      is a wooden corridor connecting the trailers that is filled with trash.
      The woman gets up and they make her sit down, she says it's probably her
      husband's brother and her son Mike beat her up. They say it is such a mess
      that they want her to show them where the drugs are. He can't go back in
      there because it smells so bad, the worst he's ever found. They find bags,
      boxes and cups full of drugs. She says she's tried to clean it, but only
      has one day off a week. There is garbage and boxes piled up all over and
      they hate it. (10:47 Fight at Club) West Hollywood Sheriff's Station -
      Deputy Sean Collingsworth finds a group of people surrounding a man on the
      ground with bandages. A woman says has 25 witnesses who saw a man jump the
      guy and beat him up. They say his girl went in the club with his ticket
      and he went to get her and they jumped him. A guy pushes his way up and
      Sean cuffs him. A guy in a big hat and fringe jacket says Red threw the
      first punch and he's the one they cuffed. Sean calls for backup and says
      it was the bouncers who did this, the second one is inside. Fire rescue
      arrives. The guy is totally bloody and they beat him when he was down.
      Sean looks for people to go inside to ID the other guy. The victim says
      they kicked him in the face and he can barely keep his head up. They ask
      him where it hurts, he says his head. People cheer when they bring the
      other guy out in cuffs. The bouncers stopped the guy from going in and the
      manager is the one who started kicking. The Sgt. says the manager is
      responsible. The witnesses say he only kicked him once. They pull Red out
      and ask him what happened. He says the victim was thrown out and he came
      back in looking for his girlfriend. He told him to leave and they fought.
      He held him down and they victim tried to kick and punch him and the other
      guys. He hit him and didn't see anyone kick him. So he is arrested too.

      Person) LA County, Malibu Sheriff's Station - Deputy Gary Spencer says
      Malibu is different than lots of locations because of the greater
      distance, sometimes it takes more than 15 minutes to get to a call. People
      are people whether they are criminals or car thieves, it doesn't matter
      where you work, there's law enforcement to be done. He stops a car and
      Brian the driver says he's never been arrested before. Gary says he has
      two kinds of weed on him. Deputy Daniel McCann tells him he's in trouble
      and he swears it's not his and can show the keys. (10:50 PM Drug
      Investigation) They have Brian call in to make a deal with his buyer.
      (11:27 PM) They have him, it's Saturday night, time to go to jail. The
      dealer is an obese white guy with a mullet in a fancy white pickup truck.
      He's so big they need 2 handcuffs and might even need 3. They find a wad
      of cash and high quality cocaine off a kilo brick. The size and type leads
      them to believe he is a dealer and they write up a search warrant, present
      it to Judge Lawrence Mira and go to his house. (1:45 AM) They arrive at
      the judge's house, he signs it and Gary swears on it. (2:40 AM Warrant
      Served) They bang on the door and get no answer, so they kick it in. They
      find an ounce of coke in the closet, a shotgun and shells in the bedroom.
      They started their shift at 5pm and now it's over at 4am. They'll file the
      paperwork and hopefully be done at 6:30am, get home and start again
      tomorrow. (4:40 PM Roll Call) South East County Sheriff's Station - The
      captain says for shoplifting if they are going for a felony to file
      burglary and theft with a prior and they can get them for 16 months on a
      first offense. Let them know they are going to state prison so they won't
      go out and rip off cars. Deputy David Halm listens. (5:40 PM Traffic Stop)
      David spots a car with no registration. He pulls out Robert the driver who
      knows his headlights are out. He says he has no guns or drugs, he just
      forgot to put the lights on. He wasn't putting anything under the seat
      where they saw him digging, but they find a pellet gun there. He likes to
      target shoot. They find black face makeup in the trunk. He says it's from
      Halloween, he doesn't clean his car out much. Dave asks if he's doing any
      robbery. He says no, but has been in jail seven times. He was arrested for
      meth, but hasn't done it since the last time he was in jail. He has a
      massive key ring with hotel keys. He says he just picked them up and
      collects them. He claims he owned seven cars at one time, but there is
      more than seven sets of keys. They had a robbery a couple weeks ago by a
      man in black face. They don't know all the details, so they'll take him in
      to run him. He claims the makeup is for his kids' costume. (7:15 PM
      Robbery Investigation) They go to the supermarket that was robbed a couple
      weeks ago. They find a bagger who was there that night. He said the guy
      had a painted face and a gun. He didn't see the gun and he also had a fake
      beard. A woman says he showed the gun in his jacket. It sounds like their
      suspect so they go back to the station and read the report. The guy left
      on foot, was wearing makeup, possibly a white male. They are going to book
      him for robbery. (8:11 PM Multiple Shooting) They are looking for suspects
      wearing masks who had AK-47s. They picked the suspects out and executed
      them. David pulls up to a body shop and there is blood and guts on the
      street. Deputy Eric Stewart was first on the scene. One guys' leg was
      blown off, another guy was shot in the gut and his intestines came out.
      Deputy Fred Bertsche talks to one guy. They were watching Star Search,
      working on their cars, putting a radio in and then the shooting started
      and he split. EMS comes in and treats people. EMS says the first guy was
      across the street with an ankle wound, two guys were by the Pepsi machine
      with one with a head wound and the other was eviscerated, a guy was by the
      car with his stomach shot open and the fifth victim got over the fence and
      cut his foot open. Sgt. Cole Hughes says they chased the people through
      the parking lot and fired at them. They found a 308 shell, a large round.
      A woman was on the phone calling the police and heard someone yell,
      &quot;Where's the money? Get on the floor!&quot; One had a red rag in
      their pocket so it seems gang related. They had a gang shooting two weeks
      ago where kids shot at cops with AK-47s. They think they know where the
      guys are. It's ironic that up on the wall is a Crimestoppers security
      alarms sign. They install them in cars, but not on their own door. #227.

      talks to one of the female workers who says one of the shelves with the
      cookbooks was on fire. She thought they could put it out, but it just
      erupted. She takes them into the burned out room to point out the books
      that were stacked up and on fire. They are to call immediately to say it's

      competent. He's made lots of improvements with codes, rules and

      always discusses payments in advance. She's on a crutch and her left foot
      is in a cast. They shot her and robbed her of $1100, then the next time
      they took $400. She didn't know she was shot, she heard that a bullet
      wound doesn't hurt, but it hurt. There was a hole in her shoe, it went
      through the first and second toe, went up and broke it in 3 pieces. She's
      got someone to rough him up. She won't call the cops because the girls
      will beat him up. He says let them take care of it. She says they hate
      her. He asks her if she wants to get off the street. She says yeah, but
      how? He says to work with him and arrest this guy, get the SOB off the
      street. She says to talk to her tomorrow. She's going home to change
      because no one will pick her up since she looks like she's handicapped.
      They just won't do the right thing. Robin went to his 30th high school

      County Sheriff's Department Homicide Investigation - George calls the
      police to say his wife is lying on the floor it looks like someone broke
      into his house and stabbed her. He didn't check the body to see if she's
      breathing. The dispatcher tells him to check. She's dead in a large pool
      of blood. He called into Lakewood Station at 8:33am, said he woke up and
      found her. Lt. Joe Brown investigates, talks on the phone and has a theory
      about it. They check the closets and the fridge, but there is no alcohol
      in the house. They talk to the neighbor. He's known them for years, they
      have no problems and he saw them a few days ago to pay the rent. He has no
      idea why someone would want to kill her. They check the stab wound and see
      it was a large wound that must've been 12 inch knife. They roll her over
      and to take pictures. They load the body up and the blood is leaking
      through the sheets. They find the murder weapon and there is nothing
      stolen, nothing ransacked. The husband was home when they got there. They
      are going to talk to the husband and stepson at the station. (2:38 PM
      Homicide Bureau) They ask George his story. He usually sleeps late, but he
      woke up early. She was already up, so he decided to get up. He's slow to
      get dressed and took five minutes. He opened up the door and she was lying
      there in a pool of blood. They say there is a problem, something happened
      this morning. They all know he murdered his wife and he can't face up to
      the fact that he did it. Something happened to make him mad. How did the
      blood get on the top of his shoes? He says he doesn't know what it was, it
      was there for days. He thought it was her paint or Crayolas. (4:46 PM
      Homicide Bureau) They ask if he washed his hands after finding her. They
      take samples from between his fingers to see if he has blood stains. If
      it's positive it'll change to purple or pink and it won't matter if he
      washed his hands. His hands are very sweaty and he says it's from his
      medication. She continues to swab his hands. It's not a specific blood
      test, it's presumptive to allow them to investigate further. They pull out
      his shoes that have red on them as well as hair and possible brain matter.
      They talk to the stepson and ask if George is capable of harming his
      mother. He doesn't know, she met him when he was 5 and he's 18 now. He's
      never seen him get mad, he raised his voice once in a great while and he's
      a soft mellow person. He wants to know if someone else besides George
      stabbed her. They don't know. He wants to know where she is. They say at
      the coroner's office. (1:10 PM Tuesday) Crime Lab - It turns out she
      wasn't stabbed, she was shot in the back of the head and it shattered.
      They want the shoe analyzed for brain matter. He told them that he
      approached he wife from behind between her legs and touched her from the
      back, but the pool of blood was by her head. She analyzes the Reebok
      tennis shoe in a lab. There was no exit wound. She puts the shoe on a
      microscope and they wonder about the power. She says the red is clear like
      strawberry jam, certainly not blood. His story is going to stand, maybe
      she let someone in. They'll have to get prints from the knife, maybe she
      stabbed the suspect and he stabbed her. She brought a knife to a gunfight.
      (2:30 PM Friday) There are no prints on the knife and no motive for the
      husband. It could've been a rapist or an opportunist. George says when he
      went to call 911 the phone was unplugged. He had to plug it back in. It's
      always plugged in because he has a recorder for the rental properties he
      owns. Maybe someone got in with a phone company uniform. Temple City
      Sheriff's Station (911 Call Assault with a Deadly Weapon) A woman calls
      about an attack from a man in a green Jeep with a white top. He just got
      on the freeway and they go to look for it. They spot a pickup truck
      heading west with a bunch of junk in the back with a tarp over it. There
      are three people in the truck, one child. It's heavy traffic so they can't
      make a stop. (5:11 PM Felony Stop) They pull him over on Rosemeade Blvd.
      He's an older Mexican guy in a cowboy hat. They pull him out at gunpoint
      and tell him it's not a joke. Then they call the younger Mexican guy out
      and tell him to put his hands out the window, but he doesn't listen. The
      white male passenger tries to get out to, and they yell at him to get back
      in. He finally gets out and is filthy. The suspect is Jessie Barber wanted
      in the murder of George's wife, but this guy's not the one. Deputy Patrick
      Martinez says to cut them loose and explain what happened. Deputy Ann
      Brannon has to explain. There was a serious crime down the street that
      matched the description. He thought he was the one blasting the radio in
