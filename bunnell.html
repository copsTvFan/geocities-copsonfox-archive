<p>John Edwin Bunnell was born on May 25, 1944 in Pendleton, Oregon during World
War II, but he didn't become a star until 1989 when he appeared in the second
season of Cops. He joined the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office in 1969. When he
appeared on Cops he was a Sgt. and rose through the ranks to become Chief
Deputy. When Sheriff Robert G. Skipper retired in 1994 before the end of his
term, he appointed Bunnell to head the agency. Bunnell took the oath of office
on November 30, 1994. He retired 6 months later in May 1995 (though on Police
Videos he said he was in law enforcement 25 or 27 years). He appeared in 10
episodes of Cops, a record number of appearances that hasn't been beat in 21
seasons. He stood out right away with his extremely white teeth, extra tan skin,
dark sunglasses, lush combed back silver hair, take charge persona and wise cracking mouth. He was fun to
watch, had star quality and became the first and only breakout star on the show.
In 1991 he hosted episodes of American Detective. In 1997 he was free to pursue
TV full time and played himself as the host of
Fox hour long specials called the World's Scariest Police Chases starting with
the second one. The next year
he also hosted&nbsp; The World's Wildest Police Videos, later just Police Videos, from 1998 to 2002. On Thursday nights right after Police
Videos he sometimes hosted another special for 2 hours a night of Bunnell. In 2001 he made his debut in a movie called Ghost World playing
Seymour's Boss and 2 years later he played the police chief in Bad Santa. Both
are directed by Terry Zwigoff. He appeared on Maury and a Cops special in 2005. He did not appear again until 2008 when he
appeared in two long commercials for ID Watchdog an identity theft protection
company.</p>
