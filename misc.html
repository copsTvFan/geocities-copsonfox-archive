<p align="left">&quot;A girlfriend of mine, the blonde one in the episode was
completely hammered and needed a ride home from a party. So when I arrived at
the house to pick her up, the homeowner asked if I would also take this really,
really drunk guy (the stabbing victim) home since it was on my way. I said yes,
then another man from the party asked if he could also get a ride home (he was
the other witness in the episode). We arrive at my girlfriend's house and I am
helping her out of the backseat and the sober guy was helping the drunk guy out
also because I was leaving him at her house. The drunk guy seemed to be yelling
profanity at this white car that was approaching and gave them the middle
finger. The car approached slowly, he walked up to the passenger side, and then
the car sped off. I ran over to see what happened. The sober guy said he thought
that they punched him in the face because he was bleeding from his nose and
mouth, but he didn't look right to me. He looked like he was going into shock
and I noticed his shirt was soaked in blood. I told the sober guy who lifted his
shirt to find his intestines were hanging out.. It was disgusting and I
screamed. The sober guy called the police and they showed up with a Cops crew.
It was crazy. Apparently, when he walked up to the car, some guy reached out and
stabbed him for no reason. They didn't know each other. The guy survived. When I
went to visit him, he couldn't recall a thing. Also I was never asked to sign a
release.&quot; Ann Marie (9:27 PM Stabbing
Call) episode #1336</p>

<p align="left">&quot;It was a hot and humid, late-summer evening and I worked a double shift
that day. The Cops crew and me had just left a Cuban sidewalk cafe after downing
a couple &quot;shots&quot; of Cuban coffee. During that time of my career and
right up to retirement I lived on &quot;shots&quot;. I was told to drive an
older 1996 model police car with no cage to accommodate the Cops camera &amp;
sound guys. At the time my car was a newer model with a cage. I hated driving
older vehicles in general because they weren't new, they smelled, had loose
handling, didn't look good, and ultimately I did not look good driving it. I
recall vigorously arguing with the Captain about that. I lost. I arrived on the
call of a &quot;male shooting a gun&quot; with my interior dome light on, AFTER
shutting off my blue/red lights and headlights. We knocked on every door in the
immediate area looking for a victim, but we never found one even though the
&quot;Sissy Boy&quot; guy insisted he shot at several people. Turns out the
majority of people in the area were illegal aliens who didn't want to get
involved for obvious reasons. Sissy Boy was eventually arrested for a $50
warrant out of Monroe County for catching undersized groupers. Monroe County actually
confirmed the message and promised to extradite him, only to change their minds
the next morning, whereupon he was released. (Monroe County is the southernmost
county in Florida, known for world famous fishing, the Florida Keys, and
evidently illegal undersized groupers.) During the entire incident, the
Cops camera operator kept grinning and repeatedly chanting, &quot;This is great
TV!&quot; My sister still gives me crap about the &quot;donde esta la
pistola&quot; line I used on Sissy-Boy guy. I met up with Sissy Boy while working an
off-duty job a few years later. I turns out he's a Cuban refugee and had both
knees broken by Fidel Castro's secret agents while incarcerated in Cuba. He
remembered the arrest and thanked me for treating him with respect and
dignity. To this day, my then-sergeant maintains this was the best and most
authentic Homestead PD Cops segment ever. Thanks for the great
website and thanks for watching.&quot; Tom Swartz episode #1534</p>

<p align="left">
&quot;At the time I was filmed I was visiting Alaska on vacation. I loved it t here so
much I went home to Georgia...packed up and moved up t here permanently. So I
board the train to go back to Portage and get my car to drive back into
Anchorage and hurry and go home to clean up before meeting these darling men for
dinner. After all, I had been in and out of the rain all day on the boat and I
looked like hell, as you see on the show. So I am racing down the Seward
highway and when I exit onto Dowling I see three police cars coming up FAST
behind me and I think hmmm I better pull over and let them go around me
because obviously they are in high pursuit of something. Next thing I know I am
surrounded by the cars. When the guy popped out with the camera I jumped out of my
car and in my very thick southern accent said &quot;I swear I don't have a
gun!&quot; The cop asked me how fast I was going and I very innocently said
&quot;I don't know&quot; and he said &quot;I don't know either because I have
been trying to keep up with you for miles!&quot; All I could think of to say is
that I didn't know my car could go that fast and that I swear I was not
intentionally recklessly driving on your roads. It was then that he made me
swear not to do it again. And I did, because after all I was returning the car
the next morning anyway.&nbsp; I proceeded to have a very fun dinner with the
two men from Ohio, you can imagine how that event gave us some really colorful
conversation to exchange. When the show aired
and they finally saw that I had been telling them the truth that night at
dinner. It haunted me for many years because some folks thought I
shouldn't have been let go and the poor cop that let me go got a huge ration
of you know what from the local community.&quot; Very best regards -
Andréa Meché episode #309 - 10:33 PM Street Patrol</p>

<p align="left">&quot;Thanks for the attention. It is still a great show and I am proud to have had
something to do with it's genesis.&quot; Duane Tudahl (Editor/Assistant Editor
for Cops)</p>

<p align="left">&quot;I had just returned from
being on active duty with the Marine Corps during Desert Storm. My incident is where a red pick up is on the side of the
road. The call was
initiated by the other Park Ranger you see in the episode. I am the Park Ranger with the
glasses there to
assist as I was that ranger's supervisor.&nbsp; The owner &quot;Gary&quot; is a former Joplin, MO police officer and he
was
extremely intoxicated. The KCPD officer is Scott Caron who tries to perform
field sobriety on him. I appear to
have pushed Gary face first into the ground, but I did not push him at all.
He was just barely able to walk and was stumbling towards me and the roadway. I
just did not want him to fall into the lane of traffic, but those who
do not know this think I pushed the guy down. I barely touched him, but it sure looks like I shoved him. (It it is funny though) I felt bad so I
reached down and assisted Scott in picking the guy up, oh man he was just gross.
He was
VERY hot, sweaty and stinky. He got his sweat all over me when I picked
him up. That was like 17 years ago and I remember it very well even today. The
day that episode aired I received many calls from all over the nation from
people who knew me. Even to this when they rerun I still get
calls about it. Pretty funny deal!&quot; Major Larry B. Niederschulte episode #402</p>

<p align="left">&quot;I also love the show Cops and have been watching since the first episodes
when I was kid. It was always a dream of mine to be a police officer and my ultimate
goal was to be on Cops. Well that dream came true in my second year on
the street as a Tampa Police Officer. I love my job and can't believe I get paid
to do it. I have seen my episode on TV over a dozen times and it
still gets me as excited as it did the first time I saw it on TV. Great work with
the site. Thanks.&quot; Jason Tkach episode #531</p>

<p align="left">My son Bobby Godell was filmed in 1995 for the show, but his footage never
aired until Street Patrol in 2008. He was the Liaison Officer for
some of the COPS episodes in Kansas City, KS and a hostage negotiator. We lost him in 1999 at the age of
35 from a blood disease possibly contracted after 7 hours in a meth lab. I actually met John
Langley when we
had a party at our house. COPS quit coming to KC when our chief started
disciplining officers for smoking, a baseball hat with a beer logo on a plainclothes
officer or unbuttoned jacket. Remember the chase from KC MO to KC KS when the
vehicle was on rims for miles on I-70? The chief timed an unmarked patrol car
between mileage markers and the officer beat that. COPS claimed there were
missing frames to shorten the time span.&nbsp; Jerry Godell&nbsp;5/08</p>

<p align="left">&quot;I think your site is pretty neat. I'm glad to see that that police officers
still have some friends in the community, good job!&quot; George Haake&nbsp;episode
#1703&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">&quot;I was the paramedic that took care of the guy sitting on
the stairs. The funny part about it is that I was so frustrated with the
commotion going on around us due to the filming of the show that I really let
loose with a string of unlady like language. I didn't think I would make it on
the show because they couldn't find 15 seconds that they didn't have to
bleep out. Much to my surprise, a few months later I was walking through the
waiting room of a Jersey City hospital and people started pointing at me. When I
looked at the TV in the waiting room, there I was! Believe it or not, someone in
my household taped over my copy of the show.&quot; Deborah episode #320</p>

<p align="left">&quot;Cops is an existential variety show. There's nothing
wrong with the multitude of reality shows floating around the TV landscape.
But some have neither the subtlety nor the substance of a cobweb. We just do
what we do.” - John Langley</p>
