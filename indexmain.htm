<p align="center">Most famous intro warning:<br>
Due to the graphic nature of this program, viewer discretion
is advised.<br>
Cops is filmed with the cooperation of the men and women of law
enforcement.&nbsp;<br>
 All suspects are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.</p>

<p align="center">Officially the 750th episode was 3/21/09 and I had 771 listed.
The 700th episode was 11/10/07, but no explanation of their
count is ever offered. I had 718 at the time. Some best ofs are counted as regular episodes, but 12 are not and maybe they don't count some of the 2 hour specials - but I do. Also some episodes have become quietly banned and removed from syndication.</p>

<p align="left">COPS on Fox has been my favorite TV series since 1989. It airs
at 8pm on Saturday nights and has ever since it started, later adding a second
episode, sometimes a new one, usually a rerun, right after. Then America's most
Wanted follows. In the mid 1990s I tried to find out how many episodes there
were or an episode guide. No one ever had an answer from the
official site to TV Guide to wherever, and still don't. So I started my own
Episode Guide for it since no one else ever would and in 2001 started posting it
online and now all the pieces are in place, but some production numbers may not
be exact because there are episodes that are banned or have segments that have
been replaced. I have been taping Cops since the first season and have every single one recorded. I have written summaries for every episode, but I haven't posted them all yet, so if it's not listed I should be able to find it.</p>

<p align="center">geocities is going away in 2 months. So the site will be moved
to <a href="mailto:thrawn03@yahoo.com">http://copsonfox.hostrator.com<br>
</a>Started a page for <a href="22.html">Season 22</a>, updated the <a href="episodelist.html">Episode
List</a> with room for 22. The first episode to air in 2010 with be Cops FOURTH
decade on the air if you can believe that.</p>

<p align="center">7/26/09</p>
The show WILL GO ON!! Season 22 will start on 9/12, less than 2 months to go! Hopefully they will keep new episodes at 8:30pm so sports don't ruin their airings.
<p align="center">7/25/09<br>
Added details to episodes #2133, #2134 and tonight's #2136 and that completes <a href="21.html">Season 21</a>.


<p align="center">7/17/09<br>
I found what I think is the long lost episode #120 of <a href="streetpatrol.html#s1">Street Patrol</a> so I added the details about it, all 4 officers including 3 who were on Cops and it makes it the 50th town featured.

<p align="center">6/11/09<br>
Added details to the latest episode #2131 number 780 <a href="21.html">Season 21</a>. Thankfully they aired it at 8:30PM so is wasn't preempted. <br>

<p align="center">5/5/09<br>

</a>4/26/09<br>
21 seasons and still no loyalty from Fox. Last night they
let the Yankees game go 95 minutes late and didn't air the first episode of Cops
and they could've aired the second one by not playing the intro and going right
into it, but no they added all the extra commercials and made it in progress on
all 3 Fox stations. It doesn't look like a new Cops until 5/16 as NASCAR is on
the schedule again.<br>
