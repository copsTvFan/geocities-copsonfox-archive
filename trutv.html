<p>On 1/1/08 Court TV became truTV, mainly because it had been a long time since
they showed all the court coverage they used to. With that change came the third
version of Cops which I've seen referred to as Cops 2007 (though they aired in
2008) which is the new date
at the end of the show. These are 3 old
segments packaged together for the first time under a new title, new logo and
new fonts for the towns.</p>
