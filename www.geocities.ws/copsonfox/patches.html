<title>Cops on Fox - Police Patches from the Show</title>

<h1 align="center">Cops Police Department Patches List</h1>
<p>In early 2007 I was sent a patch from an officer in Sacramento whose partner
was featured on the show which was really cool. If your department was on the
show I would like to get your patch as well to include here. Not every town
featured on the show has its own patch. For example the LAPD covers a wide area
of towns like Hollywood, Van Nuys, Venice Beach, etc.</p>
