      FL - 8:46 PM Traffic Stop) Sheriff's Office District 3 - Cpl Matthew Ott
      spots a vehicle traveling at a
      higher than posted speed through a neighborhood known for drug activities.
      The Corporal stops the vehicle and the driver immediately opens his door
      and questions the reason behind the stop. When Ott asks the man to step
      out of the car, the agitated man exclaims 'f--k this sh-t' and drives
      away. Corporal Ott pursues only to have the suspect vehicle make a u-turn
      and head towards him. The corporal continues the pursuit for a short
      distance and watches as the driver drives off of the highway and the
      passenger bails from the vehicle. The driver is pulled from the car at gun
      point and the female passenger is retrieved from her hiding place. The
      female claims she wasn't in the car and doesn't know the driver, but
      shortly thereafter she shouts her affections towards the man and calls him
      by name. The frustrated corporal eventually gets a confession from her as
      she breaks down and admits that the two were at a bar and had a few
      drinks. She also stated that the man had crack in the vehicle. Another
      deputy arrives on scene with a pill bottle filled with crack that has been
      recovered from the scene of the initial encounter with the suspect. The
      driver continues to extol his innocence and states he recently was
      released from jail and has no intention of going back. (Spokane, WA - 2:41
      AM Domestic Disturbance Call) Officer Brian Eckersley responds to a possible
      domestic in progress on the side of the road. He finds a male standing
      underneath a tree and spots a female in the tree. The man explains that
      the intoxicated woman climbs trees all of the time and is currently upset
      over some family problems. Eckersley suggests that the two calm down and
      find a place to sleep it off. In the second part, the officers spot a
      vehicle that has apparently hit a tree and determine that that driver had
      a few drinks that evening and nodded off before running into the tree.

      the vehicle involved in the possible activity and questions the driver and
      passenger. They both state that they are construction workers on their way
      to buy supplies. The officers ask both men from the vehicle and pat them
      down. They find $800 in cash on the passenger. Neither man claims to know
      what the man that ran away was doing near their car. The officers find a
      baggie of crack cocaine on the floor and question the men again. The
      passenger first claims that the man tossed the dope inside the vehicle,
      then he claims the man also threw the $800 at him, then changes his story
      and states the dope and the money are the driver's possessions and he
      was trying to protect his co-worker. #2101. 9/6/08</td>
