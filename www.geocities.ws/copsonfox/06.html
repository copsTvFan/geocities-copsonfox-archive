      <b>Indianapolis, IN 5</b> (2:24 AM Stolen Car) North District - Officer Tom
      Shaffer works as a community center director in a lower class
      neighborhood. He feels it makes him relate better to people in the
      neighborhoods he patrols, they assist him better too. A helicopter is
      following a stolen car that a guy just bailed out of, two guys ran in
      different directions and one is hiding under a tree. Cops spill out and
      run after him. Officer Pauli Irwin was chasing two different cars. A K-9
      is brought in and the dog bites a guy behind a dumpster and he screams. He
      says the other guy was the driver who told him to run and not to let the
      dog bite him again. They stole a car, got into another stolen car,
      stripped another and got in a third car. They find the driver in an orange
      and black jacket under a car and he already has handcuffs on. The ignition
      has been punched and there is a fake key. Pauli says there were four of
      them who ran, the guy in orange is the driver. The red car is also stolen
      and has bags of coke in it. Officer Jim Briner says there are 4 stolen
      cars, the van had 6 guys and 2 guns in it. Jim pulls out the guns. One is
      an old colt with 6 shots loaded and the other is a Beretta 9mm. East
      District - Officer Emmanuel Toliver uses a baseball analogy. Life a team,
      know who is on what base, every one gets a chance to bat, you might get a
      homerun or strikeout, but everyone gets to play. He rushes to a call for
      assistance, the subject is fighting. A black guy, Patrick, has a bloody
      hand, a hole on his arm with something sticking out and blood all on his
      pants. He is trying to put his jacket over it, won't listen and doesn't
      want to be looked at. An EMT says his hand is ice cold, there is severe
      damage and he needs to go to the hospital. He says he has to take care of
      something and will go to the hospital when he's ready, just not now. He
      walks away and Emmanuel cuffs him, he is forcing him to the hospital. He
      won't get in the ambulance and they have to force him in. They strap him
      to a gurney and he says they are hurting him. He says that's his fault.
      Pat was upset with a girl and doesn't like the police and wanted to fight.
      At the hospital he says he was fighting with his woman and she cut him
      with a bottle, but didn’t mean to cut him that bad. He wasn't under
      arrest, he was detained and he appreciated it. (10:03 PM Breaking &amp;
      Entering). Officer David Schultz works the tactical shift from 7pm to 3am
      and it suits him well, he doesn't go to bed before 2am anyway. He runs
      into an apartment, it is dirty and the garbage is overflowing. A stoned
      looking guy has blood on his shirt and they make him sit in the kitchen.
      In the living room there is a man down, a guy on crutches and a hysterical
      woman. The guy on the floor goes into a seizure and starts flailing all
      around. He doesn't live there and just came through the back door and
      started grabbing people. The stoner says they stopped him. The seizure guy
      has a bloody face. Cops smell glue, enough to get a buzz. Sgt. Chris
      Mosier arrives and they tell him the guy on crutches whacked him in the
      face. The woman says the seizure guy was okay outside a minute ago. Stoner
      says he didn't hit him. Then how did he get blood all over him? They find
      a can of toluene and go into the basement and find another can they are
      huffing. There is a woman on a mattress down there who is tallywagged out.
      It is a huff house with 6-7 people there, even the dog is high, it's
      shaking around. They go out to the garage and find 6-7 empty cans of
      toluene and the whole place is burned up from fire. #644. 5/7/94</td>
