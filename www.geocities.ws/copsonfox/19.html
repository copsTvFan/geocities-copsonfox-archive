      stop. The individual behind the wheel tells deputies he is meeting a
      friend and yells &quot;Pocahontas!&quot; towards a person walking away.

      met the suspect on a phone chat line and was meeting with the man for a
      date. The respectful deputy runs Pocahontas’ info and learns that he has
      an outstanding warrant. The male suspect in the original traffic stop is
      also arrested after the vehicle he is driving is determined to be stolen.

      Vegas Metropolitan Police Department during a traffic stop on the famous
      Las Vegas Strip. Officer Rosenthal informs Officer Jahn that the reason
      for the initial stop is for several flashing blue lights attached to parts
      of the vehicle – an automotive decoration that is illegal in Nevada.
      Officer Jahn questions the female driver and learns that she was out to
      pick up her friend near a casino on the Strip. The officer informs her
      that her passenger is only 18 and has priors for prostitution; a fact the
      driver claims to have no knowledge of. The 18 year old passenger is told
      that she has been ordered off the Strip for prostitution activities by the
      Vice Unit. While neither woman admits that they are currently engaged in
      prostitution activities, the 18 year old tells Officer Rosenthal that her
      pimp has beaten and tased her in the past and she does not know how to get
      out of the lifestyle. She is taken to jail while the driver is released
      and admonished for potentially maintaining a vehicle for prostitution.
