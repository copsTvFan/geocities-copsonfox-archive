<p align="center"> <b>My 9/08 exclusive with Deputy Paul Terrusa of Los Angeles,
CA episodes 219, 221, 222, 225, 228 &amp; 229</b> </p>

</center>

<p><b>Were you fresh out of the academy when the show started?</b></p>
<p>No, I did 18 months in the county jail doing a variety of jobs.</p>
<p><b>How was Sean Collinsworth to you? In some episodes it seems like he had a
big head.</b></p>
<p>He is a great cop and actually too smart. He pissed off a lot of supervisors
and deputies because he was too smart for them. I just had to deal with him and
had no other choice.</p>
<p><b>In #219 you are shown being evaluated for the first and only time in the
history of the show and it wasn't entirely favorable. How was that experience?</b></p>
<p>It was a typical eval. No one knows anything in the beginning and your first
few evals show that you don't. Everyone knows what it's like at the beginning.</p>
<p><b>He says your score is 2.8, what was that out of?</b></p>
<p>I don't remember what the scoring curve was.</p>
<p><b>Episode #219 ends with Dedicated to the memory of Deputy Jack Murphy. Was he killed in the line of duty?</b></p>
<p>I don't remember who he was. He must have been a deputy who got killed. I
guess my mind was swimming back then.</p>
<p><b>In #221 that cracked me up when someone said to Sean they were making fun of
his balls when you were at baton training. I was surprised they let that on the
air. Was that because of the bike outfit he had?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Sean marched to a different drummer.</p>
<p><b>In #222 the Halloween footage is used often on the early video tapes. Is
that your most well-known scene from the show?</b></p>
<p>I never really took a poll to see where any episodes rated. I was just along
for the ride.</p>
<p><b>Were you at the call right after with the guy who tried to kill himself? I
still can't believe Sean could eat an apple while talking to him. I can barely
look at the guy since he's such a bloody mess.</b></p>
<p>Yes I was there. The key to being a survivor in law enforcement is being able
to keep everyone's problems out of your life, compassion has nothing to do with
it. I don't know them, I don't want to know them. When the call is over I'm
done, out, finished. Too bad, but too bad for them, not for me to ruin my mental
state with. I had a college teacher who let it get to him and it ran him out of a
job. I have lots more on that subject, but I'm not going to type a book here,
sorry.</p>
<p><b>In #225 they showed a public meeting where you apologized. What was going
on?</b></p>
<p>I don't know what you are referring to. I don't remember.</p>
<p><b>In #228 there is a crazy call with people throwing chairs off a balcony. Were they arrested for lying about 
being kidnapped or breaking things?</b></p>
<p>I think they promised the hotel to pay for the damage. I don't remember
arresting them, but may have.</p>
<p><b>In #229 you have to write a report on a fire. Why did the police do that?</b></p>
<p>We write a report on all fires and the fire department does their own thing.</p>
<p><b>Did it turn out to be an arson fire?</b></p>
<p>Yes, a stack of books were piled up and lit on fire, but I don't know the
outcome - insurance or pissed off employee maybe.</p>
<p><b>I like in the next scene the guy with the drug bags says he found them, it
seems like a common excuse, but why would anything think police would believe
it?</b></p>
<p>People say anything and everything when they try not to go to jail.</p>
<p><b>Then he's shown with a bag taped to him! What was his excuse then?</b></p>
<p>He had nothing to say, he was caught.</p>
<p><b>So 10 episodes later we see you good a great evaluation. Was this
vindication?</b></p>
<p>I was on training and you start out not knowing a thing, you learn and
hopefully get off training. Some get rolled up and have to try it again a year
later or get fired. I was fortunate to have a good teacher who taught me well
enough to get off training. Many years later I had to both roll a guy up and get
many trainees on their way to successful carriers.</p>
<p><b>Robin's comment about his 30th high school reunion and tributes to the
murdered students was so compelling. Was this surprising to you then or was it
commonplace for cops to see?</b></p>
<p>It depends where you work. I saw a few murdered kids, more then some
deputies, but not
as many as others. We had a 12 year old kid killed and dumped in a trash can
because the other kids at the foster house didn't like him, nice huh? That case was a big joke with a lot of us 
because of the circumstances. I can't go further, but it's how you deal with tragedy. The general public would never
understand and vilify us if they knew what was going on and said at murder
scenes. It's a survival situation for us. For the record I will say that I never
made a joke about anyone's misfortune or loss.</p>
<p><b>Is it true that Cops and other shows are no longer allowed to film with
police in LA
because of a change of laws?</b></p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p><b>Why do all drunk people when questioned by police say they only had 2 beers?</b></p>
<p>Beats me. Maybe because they hear everyone say I only had two beers.</p>
<p><b>Did people in town recognize you after the show aired?</b></p>
<p>I was on a cruise and got recognized by a couple from Texas. It was only a
few times here and there. A few times I was asked if I was that guy on cops, but
not so much told that I was the guy from cops.</p>
<p><b>Were you supposed to get paid or do you think you should've gotten paid to
appear on TV?</b></p>
<p>I think that once they found out that the show was a goldmine it would have
been nice to kick down a little something in a xmas card.</p>
<p><b>Do you think the show helped the LAPD back then?</b></p>
<p>I think it helped, sure. It showed the public that the people we deal with
are the aholes not just the cops.</p>

<p><b>Are you still on the force?</b></p>
<p>No, I left in 2000. I collect a 20 year minimum retirement for the rest of
my life and work in the high end executive protection part of the security
business with celebs, work place violence and Hollywood type parties. It's all plan cloths
or suit stuff, no uniform work.</p>

<p><b>Are you glad you were on the show?</b><br>
<br>
The show was a totally new experience. I was embarrassed for a long time when I
saw other deputies at training or other events. Lots of them said I was cool for
dealing with Sean. They saw what a hard time I had and felt like I earned my way
in. I guess I was just over thinking what people thought of me.</p>
<p><b>Did you think the show would last back then?</b><br>
<br>
I really didn't think of its longevity as I was too busy trying to get off
training.</p>
<p><b>Do you still watch it today?</b><br>
<br>
I do watch mostly to see if the bad guys get messed up in crashes or tased. Lost kids, drunks or domestic 
violence bores me.</p>

<p><a name="00">TV Guide 20th season interview with John Langley 9/12/07</a><b><br>
 Did you ever expect the show to last this long?</b><br>
<br>
I had no idea Cops would continue for 20 years, although I had
total faith that it was an interesting show with many layers of entertainment
and information.</p>
<p><b>How has it continued to spark audiences' interest?</b><br>
<br>
It's still on the air, in my opinion, because it offers the
unpredictability of human behavior in extreme circumstances. It's like an
existential variety show, with authentic decor, set against the backdrop of
street crime. No scripts, no actors, no host, no narrator. As &quot;real&quot;
as you can get! Existential TV!</p>
<p><b>Have you had to change how the show is shot over the course of the
years?</b><br>
<br>
 Over the years, we've had to film much more for much less. The good
news is, crime is trending downward; the bad news is, crime is democratic and
can affect anyone at any time.</p>
<p><b> Have your camera people ever inadvertently gotten involved in
scuffles?</b><br>
<br>
 Our rule to cameramen is to stay out of it! If you become the story,
there is no story. But over the years some guys have jumped into a situation
when asked by the officers in charge. For example, a soundman who was trained in
CPR assisted an officer in Portland because he knew CPR better than the officer.
(Ep #207)</p>
<p><b> Has anyone been injured?</b><br>
<br>
We've had a few broken bones, bloody noses and so forth from chasing
after officers who are chasing after suspects, at which time cameramen have been
&quot;clotheslined&quot; in the dark. One cameraman was hit with a two-by-four
on a party-out-of-control call. Another crew was &quot;T-boned&quot; during a
high-speed pursuit, etc (Ep #508). No major injuries, knock on wood.</p>
<p><b> Where have you shot the show?</b></p>
<p>As a road show, we've been all over the U.S. as well as overseas to
Russia, South America, England and Hong Kong. There is no single place better
than all others. It depends on the &quot;luck of the draw&quot; and whatever
happens when you happen to be there. Having said that, bigger cities obviously
mean more crime, which translates into more segments.</p>
<p><b> Do you still hear from the various officers you've worked with?</b><br>
<br>
 We stay in touch with many officers we've worked with over the years.
Many have been promoted up through the ranks, like Bill Young of Las Vegas
(former sheriff), or have moved into other high-visibility jobs, like John
Bunnell (who hosted TV shows and appeared in movies).</p>
<p><b> How often have you actually been at shoots - any of the big, most
memorable ones?</b><br>
<br>
 In earlier days I was personally present for many of the classic
moments from Cops (like the driverless car spinning in circles Ep #311). Nowadays, Jimmy
Langley, our field producer, is on location.</p>
<p><b> How will you keep the show fresh?</b><br>
<br>
 As a road show, we keep moving - without any moss growing under our
feet! Meanwhile, the variations on human behavior are endless, so that even if
you are on a routine domestic call, you can [witness] surprises and twists you
would never have expected. Cops tries to keep the viewer &quot;in the
moment,&quot; since we are a ride-along show, which means you will discover
reality - or at least a slice of it - by peeking through a window into a world
you seldom see. And you get to do it from the comfort of your couch!</p>


<p>Like the 10 O’Clock News, Cops Endures<br>
By Dave Itzkoff | 9/9/07</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two years ago, when the television producer John Langley bought the $3.5
million, seven-bedroom house here that is now his family’s weekend retreat,
with its wine cellar, vineyards and canyon vistas that once stood in for
Shangri-La in “Lost Horizon,” he wasn’t entirely sure what inspired him to
purchase it. Except that he had a grandfather - a wildcatter, con man and
scofflaw by trade - who, according to legend, once owned property in Ojai, and
Mr. Langley liked the idea of returning. “I thought it was appropriate,” he said in a recent conversation. “I
thought it was justice.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Justice is a subject that Mr. Langley knows something about, having made his
reputation and his fortune as a creator of the reality series “Cops.” For
almost two decades, “Cops” has dutifully documented police officers as they
contend with backyard perp chases, domestic disputes and the occasional moving
violation committed by a woman in a bikini.
The longevity of “Cops,” on network television and in syndication, has given
Mr. Langley the means to own homes here and in Manhattan Beach, Calif.; to buy
restaurants in both cities; and to create his own line of Argentine wines. He
has also been enriched in other ways: he has seen his attitudes on crime and
punishment in America altered dramatically by the experience of “Cops.” He
has also learned to withstand the criticism directed at the show, and to see “Cops”
as a different proposition from a generation’s worth of tabloid fare that it
inspired. “You can be entertained by it, you can be disgusted, but it is what
happened,” Langley said. “It wasn’t staged, it wasn’t scripted. I
didn’t put anyone on an island and tell them what to do.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Langley, 64, had little interest in law enforcement at the start of his
career. Born in Oklahoma City and raised in Manhattan Beach, he had earned
bachelor’s and master’s degrees in comparative literature and had nearly
completed a Ph.D. thesis at the University of California, Irvine, on the
philosophy of aesthetics when he decided to pursue work in Hollywood. He wrote screenplays; did research for Gene
Roddenberry, the creator of “Star
Trek”; and worked as a publicist on movies. But it was not until 1983, when he
and his former producing partner Malcolm Barbour made “Cocaine Blues,” an
independent documentary on the drug trade and the various tolls it had taken on
the country, that Mr. Langley was able to gain any traction in the film
industry. (Mr. Barbour retired from producing in 1994.) “I think I made a grand total of $6,000 that year,”
Langley said. “I
basically starved doing it, with three children to feed.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He continued to work where he could - as a second-unit director on the Tom
Hanks comedy “Volunteers,” as the director of a Dolph Lundgren fitness video
- until “Cocaine Blues” caught the attentionn of Geraldo Rivera, who
approached Mr. Langley and Mr. Barbour to produce a series of television
documentaries called “American Vice: The Doping of a Nation.” Broadcast in
syndication, “American Vice” consisted of cinéma vérité ride-alongs with
police officers investigating drug-related crimes, and featured three live drug
busts.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few years later, the new Fox network was scrambling for programming to
distinguish itself from its entrenched competitors, and it turned to Mr. Langley
and Mr. Barbour. In 1988 the two played their pilot episode of “Cops” for a
roomful of skeptical executives, including Barry Diller, then the chairman of
Fox, and a taciturn man Langley assumed was an accountant. At the end of the presentation,&nbsp;
Langley recalled, the mystery figure,
named Rupert Murdoch, declared, “Order four of ’em.” Those four episodes of “Cops” turned into nearly 700, and some of the
show’s earliest advocates say they are not surprised by its endurance. “You
don’t look at the 10 o’clock news going, ‘Is this going to come off the
air in four years?’ ” said Stephen Chao, a former development executive at
Fox’s television stations group. “It’s never obsolete. It doesn’t wear
out the way a Dick Wolf franchise wears out.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Chao, who ordered the show’s pilot and remains a frequent guest at Mr.
Langley’s breakfast table, added that though Mr. Langley “likes to project a
really easygoing manner and a simple-folk, Okie thing, he had this incredible
clarity about what was right and this agenda for the show.” In nearly 20 years, the formula for “Cops” has not changed at all, from
its abundant affection for hand-held cameras to its lack of voice-over narration
and music (save for its familiar theme song, “Bad Boys,” by the reggae band
Inner Circle). What has changed is Mr. Langley’s attitude toward the people depicted on
the show, those who uphold the law, as well as those who break it. “When I first went into this business, I thought, well, if they commit a
crime, they should do the time,” Langley said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But having seen America’s prison population soar to more than 2.2 million,
and with widespread prison overcrowding in California,&nbsp; Langley says he now
believes the nation should be reconsidering which crimes should be punishable by
imprisonment. “A lot of our attention is dedicated to arresting people who
have drug problems,” he said, “when the real solution may be to rehabilitate
them.” Too often, he added, “we’re asking police officers to solve social
issues, and that’s not their job. They want to arrest people that really deserve to be arrested,” he
continued, those “who are a threat to society itself.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the controlled substance of choice shifting from cocaine to crack to
methamphetamine, Mr. Langley acknowledged that his show has been an inadvertent
beneficiary of America’s drug problem. “What makes ‘Cops’ run?” he
asked. “Drugs, drugs, drugs. What’s wrong with society? Drugs, drugs, drugs.”
But he vigorously denied that “Cops” was exploiting the criminal suspects
who appear on the show, pointing out that they all sign release forms. “When
they hear that we’re not a news camera, that we’re ‘Cops,’ ” Mr.
Langley said, “they generally exclaim, ‘Oh, that’s great! When will I be
on?’ ”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And though the early success of “Cops” helped paved the way for more
manipulative reality series, Mr. Langley argued that his show’s social
conscience distinguished it from its willfully trashy imitators. “People that say it’s a guilty pleasure drive me crazy,” he said. “Is
that because they’re experiencing schadenfreude, or is it because they feel
guilty, because they see that there are things in society that are perhaps not
right, that need attention, that need fixing?” Nick Navarro, the former sheriff of Broward County, Fla., who allowed his
officers to be documented in both “American Vice” and “Cops,” said “Cops”
had made great strides in combating the guns-a-blazing stereotypes of law
enforcement officers put forth by popular culture and in making police
departments more transparent around the country. “We don’t go around shooting people left and right, and then blowing the
smoke off the barrel of the gun,” said Mr. Navarro, who now owns a private
security company in Fort Lauderdale. “Who pays our salaries as police
officers? The public. Who has a right to know everything that we’re doing,
whether we’re doing it right or we’re doing it wrong? The public.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though Langley has tried to resist the temptation to create another
reality show set in the world of law enforcement, his newest series is a sequel
of sorts to “Cops”: titled “Inside American Jail” in the incarnation
that has appeared on Court TV since August, and “Jail” in the version that
made its debut on My Network TV on Sept. 4, the show tracks perpetrators after
they are arrested and is produced by Mr. Langley’s 33-year-old son, Morgan. Despite having seen his father pioneer an untested television format and in
so doing help define the character of a struggling broadcast network, Morgan
Langley has said he does not expect “Jail” to achieve the same degree of
success. “That would be miraculous,” he said. “If we could even help out a
little bit, that would be nice.”</p>

<p>John Langley: The Man Behind &quot;Cops&quot;<br>
By Erika Waddell, Court TV for the 600th episode 5/5/05</p>
<p><b>Q: Why are people so fascinated with this show?</b></p>
<p>A: Maybe because it's still unpredictable and immediate and deals with raw
reality.</p>
<p><b>Q: I understand that you can only show the faces of people who have signed a
release form. What percentage of people sign it?</b></p>
<p>A: I'd say 90%.</p>
<p><b>Q: And is that up or down since the show started?</b></p>
<p>A: It's more. It may even be 95% now. And I think it's because
&quot;Cops&quot; has become part of pop culture, almost everybody knows the show
even if they haven't watched it. They've heard of it or they know what it deals
with, or they know the theme song. Over the years it's become almost de rigueur
to be on &quot;Cops&quot; if you happen to get caught.</p>
<p><b>Q: I feel like people would want to do it
now, it's sort of cool.</b></p>
<p>A: Yeah, they're very receptive. I mean, we have people say &quot;Get that
damn news camera out of my face,&quot; and my crew will say, &quot;We're not
with the news, we're with 'Cops',&quot; and they'll go &quot;Cool!&quot;</p>
<p><b>Q: How do you go about getting people to sign the release? If someone is
hesitant, how do you try to talk him or her into it?</b></p>
<p>A: Our guys say, &quot;Look, why shouldn't you be on? This really happened,
nobody's saying it didn't happen, this shows what happened. If you claim that
the cops have mistreated you or aren't being fair to you or whatever the case
may be, you have the proof of it. It's right on tape. Why wouldn't you want it
to be shown?&quot; I mean, they just use psychology along these lines, or try to
convince them that there's nothing to lose.</p>
<p><b>Q: Does it happen at the scene, or do you wait a
while?</b></p>
<p>A: It usually happens at the scene because they're going from call to call.
It's very difficult to track people down afterwards.</p>
<p><b>Q: What if someone's intoxicated?</b></p>
<p>A: [With] intoxicated people, we go back to get releases. So that it's
ironclad.</p>
<p><b>Q: Are people ever paid to sign the release?</b></p>
<p>A: No, we don't pay people for a release, and the reason is we're a reality
show, we're a documentary. It's about what's real. These aren't actors. We're
not going to pay them to be who they are.</p>
<p><b>Q: Do people ever try to get out of the releases?</b></p>
<p>A: Occasionally. But signing a release is a contract, and contract law is
pretty specific. Once you sign it, that's it, baby. You're an adult. You know
what you're signing. It's just like signing a purchase for a car.</p>
<p><b>Q: A disclaimer says that all suspects are innocent
until proven guilty. What percentage of people are actually convicted?</b></p>
<p>A: I have no idea, because we don't follow up on every call. It's more of a
slice-of-life show. It shows you what's happening when it's happening. It's not
a traditional documentary in that it follows the case all the way through the
courts... It doesn't go into the epilogues.</p>
<p><b>Q: How and why do you choose locations?</b></p>
<p>A: Well, I try to make &quot;Cops&quot; a road show. I like to travel it
across the country because I think it keeps it fresh and it also gives a
portrait of law enforcement all over America. So rather than just see one eye or
an eye and an eyebrow, I like to show the ears, the nose, the chin, the entire
portrait.</p>
<p><b>Q:&nbsp; Do you go back to cities that have
given you good stuff before?</b></p>
<p>A: Sometimes, yes. Sometimes we repeat cities, but never one year after
another. I usually wait and give them a break for a while. We're filming our
18th season now. The luxury of longevity is that we can keep going back to
places where we've been before and still travel the show and still incorporate
new locations.</p>
<p><b>Q: How long do you tape in each location?</b></p>
<p>A: Usually about eight weeks.</p>
<p><b>Q: How much footage do you generally have before something worthy of being on
television happens?</b></p>
<p>A: I may have eight to ten crews out at any given time, and I try to get a
show a week. I don't always succeed. Sometimes I'll get half a show and the next
week I'll get a show and a half. But it kind of averages out to that, so we're
on the road for 30 to 40 weeks a year.</p>
<p><b>Q: Do you take all the officers in an area, or do you choose certain
officers?</b><br>
<br>
A: It's like a casting call in some respects. We like to be with the most
proactive cops because that's where the most stuff happens. We like to be in the
busier areas. Otherwise you can never do a show like this because you'll sit
around. There's a lot of paperwork involved in this work and a lot of downtime,
and that doesn't make for good television. So we try to find the most proactive,
telegenic cops and the most active areas just as a matter of practicality.</p>
<p><b>Q: Are officers willing to do this?</b></p>
<p>A: Pretty much, yeah. We have a really good reception, obviously, because
it's a show about police officers, so it's kind of their show in that sense.
They're the protagonists.</p>
<p><b>Q: Do your crews ever help apprehend criminals?</b></p>
<p>A: No, that's not our job. We're there to capture what's going on, not to
create what's going on. The minute we become the story, there is no story. So
that's my mandate to all of our crews: &quot;If you're in the middle of a riot
and they start focusing on you, turn off the cameras. Get out of there.&quot;
We're under the supervision and direction of law enforcement when we're filming
with them. They're the cops, not us.</p>
<p><b>Q: When you watch a chase and the
cameraman almost has him, you're kind of rooting for him to do it.</b></p>
<p>A: What's happening is the cameraman is trying to get the shot, he's not
trying get the suspect. Sometimes the cameraman may be in better shape than the
cop and will outrun the cop, but he has to fall back and let the cop catch up.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is &quot;Cops&quot; footage ever used as evidence in a trial?</b><br>
<br>
A: Yes.</p>
<p><b>Q: How often does that happen?</b><br>
<br>
A: Not as often as you would think, but it does occasionally happen.</p>
<p><b>Q: So do you provide attorneys with footage that was not broadcast?</b><br>
<br>
A: No, never. In fact, we just recycle footage that isn't broadcast, because I
don't have the wherewithal to keep thousands upon thousands of tapes that aren't
being used.</p>
<p><b>Q: Has a police officer ever been fired or sued because of his behavior on
the show?</b><br>
<br>
A: No.</p>
<p><b>Q: Has &quot;Cops&quot; ever caught a celebrity doing something illegal?</b><br>
<br>
A: Oh yeah. Many years ago an Academy Award-winning composer was on one of our
shows, Jack Nitzsche. I think he was waving a gun around and might've been
drunk. It was in Hollywood.</p>
<p><b>Q: Does the show ever revisit arrestees from past episodes?</b><br>
<br>
A: No, but we've had arrestees from prior episodes show up in a different city
and appear again. Not intentionally, it just shows recidivism is a reality.</p>
<p><b>Q: What is your favorite segment ever?</b></p>
<p>A: You know, I'm sometimes asked this and I genuinely and honestly do not
have a favorite segment, because there have been so many, and they're like
flavors of ice cream. One day you might like Neapolitan, another day you might
like chocolate, vanilla or rocky road...</p>
<p><b>Q: Do you have a favorite genre, like Bad Girls or Shots Fired, or Best
Chases?</b></p>
<p>A: Well, to be honest with you, those are all promotional tools to get people
to watch the show. To me, the show is best when it's balanced, when it maybe has
an action piece, and then a lyrical piece, and then a think piece. Because it's
a three-segment structure. If you do all chases, my theory is you'll get tired
of the chases after a while. So you don't want to do just chase, chase, chase.
It's better to have a chase and then something that's a little slower, more
humorous, more lyrical, more whatever, and then it's nice to shift gears again
and have something that provokes thought about our laws or the nature of law
enforcement or the nature of human behavior or crime or whatever the case may
be. It's just more interesting to me that way.</p>
<p><b>Q: Do you have a favorite cop?</b></p>
<p>A: No. I've seen a lot of really great cops over the years, really proactive
and courageous, just good guys. I mean, not all cops are good guys, but the good
news is that most are. I came to appreciate police officers over the years,
because I wasn't a big fan when I was a kid. I'm a kid of the 60s, so I never
thought I would do a show called &quot;Cops.&quot; It just turns out that I like
the documentary form and I like so-called reality television. To me there's
nothing more interesting then what's real, what's true.</p>
<p><b>Q: You're pretty much the founder of reality TV.</b></p>
<p>A: Oh, I don't know if I can be blamed for that, but I was probably one of
the early guys in that genre.</p>
<p><b>Q: Tell me about the moment when you realized &quot;Cops&quot; was such a big
part of the country's pop culture.</b></p>
<p>A: When my kid came to me one day and said, &quot;Oh, my friend was on Cops
last night!&quot; (laughs). And probably when I started seeing all the spoofs. Saturday Night Live and
Mad TV have done things on us, The Simpsons has done things on us. And There's
Something About Mary. Cops was in that.</p>
<p><b>Q: What do you think about Reno 911?</b></p>
<p>A: Oh, I love it! It's flattering and amusing.</p>
<p><b>Q: Do you think there's a limit to how much you can say about law
enforcement?</b></p>
<p>A: You know, I don't think it's just about law enforcement I think it's about
human behavior, and it's about man in extremes, or woman in extremes. It's about
a context that involves a lot of different issues. It's not only law
enforcement, it's crime and punishment, it's good and bad. All the fundamental
themes of literature and film are involved in that arena.</p>
<p><b>Q: Now here's an urban myth: When police officers see people with either a
big, baggy shirt or no shirt at all, does that signal to them that they are
using drugs?</b></p>
<p>A: (Laughs) No. Not at all. Because crimes and misdemeanors come in all
shapes and forms. You can have a crew cut, wear glasses, be dressed in a suit
and be a murderer or a criminal or a crook or a con man, or you could have tats
all over your arms and wear baggy pants and be an upstanding citizen. But having
said that, if you see a bunch of kids riding around in a car and they look like
gangbangers, chances are they are gangbangers, you know what I mean? And if it's
a new car, chances are they might've stolen it. There are just fundamental experiential issues that aren't so-called
&quot;profiling,&quot; which is a big controversy. There is natural profiling
that takes part of life, and it's based on experience. If you see a guy with
tattoos all over his arms and wild, dilated pupils and he gets on an elevator
with you, are you going to feel comfortable, as opposed to a guy that gets on
that has a Brooks Brothers suit and a briefcase? I mean, how are you going to
feel at midnight on an isolated elevator? Well, cops use that same technique
based on their experience to look at likely suspects.</p>
<p><b>Q: Are you going to use that theme song forever?</b></p>
<p>A: Oh yeah, it's too much a part of [pop culture]. It's too associated with
&quot;Cops,&quot; and I wouldn't change it. I was fortunate to find it, and I'm
happy I put it in.</p>
<p><b>Q: Do you have anything that you'd like to say about the show?</b></p>
<p>A: I would say that &quot;Cops&quot; is an existential variety show with
authentic décor. How's that? Designed to instruct and entertain, in equal
parts.</p>

<p align="center"><b>My 2004 exclusive with Deputy Ruben Barela of Albuquerque, NM
in episodes 827-29/31, 833-5, 1228, 1234 &amp; TH2.</b></p>

</center>
<p><b>Q: How long did it take for the episodes to go from being filmed to TV?</b><br>
<br>
A: When they film the episodes, they stay in the filming area (in my case,
Albuquerque) for several weeks or months. After editing and all the film magic
they do to the episodes, it ended up taking several months before the final
episode aired.</p>
<p><b>Q: Did the crew say how they came to choose Albuquerque?</b><br>
<br>
A: Wherever they can get permission and have a likelihood of good television
material. Albuquerque is a growing city with big city problems. It's also fair
weathered and all around nice place to be to film in.</p>
<p><b>Q: How many members are there in the cops crew?</b><br>
<br>
A: A cameraman and a soundman ride along. Back at the studio there are other guys
who edit, do the sound, etc. In my case, Bertram Van Munster, the producer,
acted as camera man. I became good friends with him because we spent so much time
together.</p>
<p><b>Q: Did they ever get in the way or slow you down?</b><br>
<br>
A: Not really, they just stand back and film whatever happens. They don't ever try
to get in the way. Other units would have to transport suspects because the crew
would be in my car, and you couldn't try to stop a bad guy with your car (such
as do a pit maneuver) with them sitting in the car for their safety.</p>
<p><b>Q: Did the crew ever assist in an arrest when there was no backup?</b><br>
<br>
A: No, they are advised not to for their safety as well as for the officers. I'm
sure though if something REALLY bad happened, they would do something, but for
the most part, no.</p>
<p><b>Q: Were you a fan of the show before they filmed in your town?</b><br>
<br>
A: I didn't really watch the show before they filmed me.</p>
<p><b>Q: Did the guys at work talk about the episodes?</b><br>
<br>
A: Not really, but they filmed lots of episodes with me, so my co-workers joked
about it and called it the &quot;Ruben Barela Show&quot;. When you are on, you tend to get lots of fan mail as I
did.</p>
<p><b>Q: When you got fan mail what were the most common questions asked?</b></p>
<p>A: It usually consisted of girls saying I was cute on TV, but most of it said I
did a good job as a cop. I never responded to any of it, but it was a nice
gesture though I'm no longer a deputy.</p>
<p><b>Q: What has happened with your career since
you've been on Cops?</b><br>
<br>
A: I work in the casino industry now.<br>
<br>
<b>Q: Do the criminals have to sign waivers to allow their likenesses on film?</b><br>
<br>
A: They all must, otherwise they have their faces blurred. Most people sign the
waivers, just to say they were on Cops.</p>
<p><b>Q: How long were they in town filming?</b><br>
<br>
A: Several months. They stay in hotels or rent out a town home to live in for the
duration and ride along with whomever they are allowed to go along with.</p>
<p><b>Q: Was there anything they filmed that they didn’t use because it was too
graphic or personal?</b><br>
<br>
A: They don't use most of their material. Many things I thought they filmed that
were boring, compared to other things we did, that they ended up using after all.
In one
instance, there was a bad traffic accident and the kid driving died and the
city said it wasn't a good idea to show it for legal reasons and it never aired.</p>
<p><b>Q: Are officers allowed to not appear on film if they don’t want to?</b><br>
<br>
A: Nope, they film whomever is chosen as it's the city/county governings'
choice.</p>
<p><b>Q: How do they decide whom to ride with?</b><br>
<br>
A: Whomever is in charge (i.e. the chief, mayor, or whomever makes the rules)
decides. They base their choice on many things: they choose someone they know is
safe, dependable, and represents the department positively.</p>
<p><b>Q: If an officer does something they aren’t proud off are they able to tell
the crew to turn the cameras off or not use the footage?</b><br>
<br>
A: No, they use embarrassing footage too. The officers should know better than to
do something wrong, especially on film. But if they mess up, they mess up!</p>
<p><b>Q: Are there any plans for Cops to come back to Albuquerque?</b><br>
<br>
A: The mayor banned the show because the city said it showed a negative image of
Albuquerque. Maybe if they ever lift the ban, they will come back.</p>

<p align="center"><b>A 1999 Court TV web chat with&nbsp; John Langley. They
posted it on their site as is - full of bad grammar, spelling mistakes and more
then removed it. I
cleaned it up and made it readable.</b></p>
<p><b>How did your being a producer lead you to doing the Cops shows?</b></p>
<p>Years ago I did a show called &quot;Cocaine Blues,&quot; all about he cocaine
epidemic in America. That experience led to Cops via the adrenaline rush I felt
in accompanying police officers during drug busts.</p>
<p><b>How did you pick where you shoot?</b></p>
<p>Generally speaking, we are an &quot;invitational show&quot; which means that
we go where we are wanted. Nowadays, we are invited regularly to various cities
across America...and we go.</p>
<p><b>When did Cops first start filming and how was the reaction to such a show?</b></p>
<p>We began filming in 1988, around July of that year. The initial reaction from
critics and the public alike was one of amazement. We tried to portray reality
in all its raw and real environment, in this instance being the crime and
punishment arena. For that reason, I suppose, it seemed fresh and interesting.</p>
<p><b>What is your reaction to the latest court rulings of filming police in
action?</b></p>
<p>The recent reaction to the latest court rulings is this: it barely affects
us. Specifically, the ruling concerned media accompanying police officers during
search warrants. We rarely do that anymore. Moreover, we obtain releases from
anyone involved.</p>
<p><b>Which city was the most co-operative with the Cops crew?</b></p>
<p>Initially, the department most cooperative was the Broward County Sheriff's
Department in Florida, where we began the show.</p>
<p><b>What's your favorite Cops episode?</b></p>
<p>One of my favorites is the episode from Philadelphia in which police
encountered a naked burglar and wrestled with him during his arrest.</p>
<p><b>Has anybody been killed or seriously injured on Cops?</b></p>
<p>Alas, we have had several injuries. One crew was smashed during a high-speed
auto chase, wherein one cop car crashed into another. Fortunately, no one was
seriously injured.</p>
<p><b>Will you ever film in Canada?</b></p>
<p>Cops does appear in Canada at present, and I've flirted with the notion of
filming the Mounties, but so far I've not got around to it. I understand there
is a copycat show filmed in Vancouver.</p>
<p><b>Do you ever have a follow up about some of the cases?</b></p>
<p>No, that's not our mandate, so to speak. But we have had suspects appear in
more than one episode, from different cities. How's that for reality being
stranger than fiction!</p>
<p><b>Is Cops meant to be a neutral documentary or are you trying to show a
specific perspective?</b></p>
<p>From a documentary standpoint, I'm trying to show reality as raw as possible.
In that we film with police officers, we obviously share their perspective,
which makes them, in a sense, our heroes.</p>
<p><b>With the use of dash-mounted cameras is the show not as shocking?</b></p>
<p>We don't use dash-mounted cameras, so Cops continues to amaze and entertain
and inform me as it always has. I think that's its strength.</p>
<p><b>Do you think that that Cops has changed the attitude of the public towards
the police?</b></p>
<p>Definitely. Most people in the public arena looked upon cops as a nuisance.
They were the guys who gave you speeding tickets, etc. Nowadays, I think shows
like Cops demonstrate that cops, police officers, are real human beings, just
like all of us, and are subject to pain, frustration, heroism, etc.</p>
<p><b>Do you use videotapes from peoples own camcorders?</b></p>
<p>Cops only uses its own crews, we don't get footage from outside sources.</p>
<p><b>Would you say that such programs as Cops are high-quality television?</b></p>
<p>I suppose it depends upon your definition of high quality television.
Personally, I'm very proud of the program and think its contributes to a greater
understanding of our society. It doesn't preach, but you can get the message if
you watch it carefully.
As far as the other reality programs, I'm all for them in the sense that it's a
big landscape out there in television land, and the more the merrier. When I get
overly copied, I'm both flattered and annoyed at times. But, as they say, TV is
the sincerest form of imitation.</p>
<p><b>How will the Supreme Court ruling on no ride alongs affect the show?</b></p>
<p>The Supreme Court did not rule that there would be no ride alongs. That's a
misperception of their ruling. They merely affirmed the right of anyone to sue
the police if the media accompany them during search warrants and invasion of
privacy. It's really an issue of the 1st and 4th Amendments in conflict to a
certain specific degree.</p>
<p><b>What does an &quot;executive producer&quot; do?</b></p>
<p>An executive producer has the privilege of doing everything or nothing - take
your pick. Generally, it's the guy (or gal) who started a show and is ultimately
responsible for it.</p>
<p><b>Have you ever thought of filming a Military Police Cops?</b></p>
<p>At one time or another, I've considered almost everything to do with cops,
police, or crime subjects. As far as international stuff, we have filmed in
England, Russia, South America, Hong Kong, etc. But Americans tend to not like
foreign subjects, for some strange reason.</p>
<p><b>I like the show Cops but really LIKE the song. Where did you find it?</b></p>
<p>I found the song in Miami when we were filming the pilot. It seemed like the
ideal song for this series, and I wanted to counterpoint the subject with a
reggae song. As far as I knew, no one had used reggae for a theme song.</p>
<p><b>Is the producer of the show ever involved with the law? Do you have
consultants on your staff?</b></p>
<p>I've never been a police officer, although I am a reservist with a local
California P.D. We don't really have any consultants, other than the departments
we film with on a regular basis.</p>
<p><b>I think the television show Cops make the police force look
like thugs and these shows should be taken off TV.</b></p>
<p>Beauty (and reality) is in the eye of the beholder. We don't try to tell you
what to think. All we do is attempt to show what is real in a very specific
context, meaning crime and punishment arenas in which police live, breathe and
sometimes die.</p>
<p><b>How do you feel about the way some news programs like 20/20 say that the
camera forces cops to make decisions just so they don't look bad in front of the
camera?</b></p>
<p>I guess you could say the same thing for 20/20. How much do they affect their
subject matter? It's a question for philosophers and scientists.</p>
<p><b>Will we ever see Cops the movie?</b></p>
<p>Cops the movie will be made sooner or later. I've had ongoing discussions
with Fox about just that subject.</p>
