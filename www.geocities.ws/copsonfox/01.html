    <td width="765" height="1"><b>Broward County FL 1</b>  <b>Hour Pilot</b> (Full 90 second theme) Burt Lancaster - This program was filmed during a
      one-week period with the Broward County Sheriff's Department in Florida.
      All Suspects are presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.
      Sheriff Nick Navarro says it’s a unique area - to the east of them they
      have the Atlantic, to the west a big swamp called the Everglades. Because
      of the fact they have a labyrinth of waterways it makes the place very
      appealing to drug smugglers. That’s where they face them on a daily
      basis. He goes with a SWAT team to a crack house, smashing the door and
      running in. One asks for a sledgehammer, they break a door, a man is down.
      Watch it you guys, talk to me, back room is clear, double check them.
      Bathroom is clear. A woman is down in the kitchen. Nick says it’s one of
      the most disgusting sights, the garage is another bedroom where they
      sleep. There is the crack altar where they smoke it, paraphernalia where
      they smoke, down here is the toilet on the floor. It’s a bucket. This is
      a typical crack house, that’s why the close them down. He is driving and
      hears on the radio about another officer taken down in the line duty by
      shooting. He says it always happens to someone else, not to you, can tell
      you one thing, he’s been to too many funerals already. He’s had more
      cops killed in FL in 1987 than the state of NY. That’s a tradition. He
      goes to the officer's funeral. There is a fire by his house on the way
      home. Nick goes home, asks his wife to get off the phone to call in about
      it. She hangs up. He asks about any flammables there, any potential of
      spread. If you see any potential please let him know and he’ll head
      down. He hangs up, he’s sorry, what a way to come home, that’s the way
      it’s been all day, another beautiful day. On the TV news they say it’s
      the worst fire in the everglades, it’s a chemical plant in the Port. Don
      from the news reports on scene. Communications center - a call of
      something on a 900 block. (District 2)
      Deputy Jerry Wurms stops a black man in his car at a convenience store and
      finds a gun. A man and a woman are seen in a known drug area and are questioned because he is white in an all black area. When he goes to get
      her wallet out of the car he takes it and runs. Jerry chases him and says,
      &quot;Stop or I'll shoot you in the back!&quot; He doesn't stop. He is caught and they are
      both arrested. She goes insane and screams her innocence. (Headquarters -
      Organized Crime Division) Capt. Ron Cacciatore takes calls and answers
      questions from Sgt. Dennis Gavalier and Deputy Vicki Cutcliffe.
      He then goes out and talks to an officer and goes to a coke buy at a train
      station. He and the undercover officer catch a guy with his wife with two
      kilos of coke and bags of cash. The girl doesn't want to talk and just
      wants to puke. Drug Task Force Briefing - A map is on the board and the
      group discusses it. (7:03 PM Field Briefing) During a lightning storm. Ron
      returns home to watch Superman on TV and his wife heard about
      the train bust on the news and wants to talk about it. She wants to know
      the details, but he doesn't want to talk about it. She says she married
      him because he is a cop and thought their lives would be exciting, but
      their communication level is zero. He says he just wants to relax and not
      talk about work. Besides, if he did tell her, he'd have to kill her. (7:15
      PM Warrant Served) Their driver is told to slow down and then the cops spill
      out and slam into a crack house. A giant fat, black man won't surrender
      and they have to tackle him. Another suspect who makes the drugs is
      questioned. It is his parents' house and they all will be arrested. The
      son refuses to talk and he tells him he had his chance. (9:00 AM) Sgt.
      Richard Scheff goes to work and gets a call about a dead body found
      floating in a nearby canal. They go there by helicopter as it is pulled
      out. They found his clothes on the shore inside out. He is nude and his
      body has not been eaten yet and there is no sign of trauma. (Roll Call
      District 2) Lt. Bob Rios talks about the guy Jerry chased in the first
      part. He talks about how it is to be a cop and about his girlfriend.
      She is Deputy Linda Canada whom he works with. We then see her stop a
      suspected prostitute, then an older woman on the street. (8:45 AM Canada
      Home) Jerry makes breakfast for her two kids including a two year old and
      he explains how he is planning on moving in with her. They eat breakfast
      and read about an officer who just died. (Officer in Court) Airport
      Interdiction Officer - Vickie goes to the airport and randomly searches
      people for drugs and most give her a hard time. Then she is at home with
      her two kids playing in the yard. The next day she and her partner are at
      the airport searching people again. The second guy is all nervous, then
      gets angry and says the bag he has isn't is. Then he wants a warrant. Then
      he admits the bag is his. She arrests him and he goes nuts and starts
      fighting everyone and she goes down. They take him away and find he had a
      stolen gun and six ounces of coke. He then calls his girlfriend and mom to
      tell them he's going away for a while. Vickie has been doing the same
      job for ten years. (Crackdown Briefing) On July 8th they are going to
      arrest 150 people, tow 200 cars and bulldoze houses. Sheriff Nick then
      goes up in a helicopter and the rest of the team gears up. (8:47 AM Crack

      Sheriff Nick Navarro gives a re-election speech while the Rocky Theme plays. He wants to make
      the county a better place. Trojan Horse Briefing. Cops cut cardboard to
      make a big box to hide inside the back of an an El Camino. Sgt. Robert
      Deak says the dogs will jump out and get them, can fill the truck up with
      drug buys. Dealers learn what the tactics are - never sell to a van or car
      with two people in it so they have to come up with new ideas. A black guy
      comes up and sells a rock for $10 and wants to sell another $10. They jump
      out of the box and get him. They go to a second stop and grab another
      black dealer. The driver jokingly wants them to let him know if the box
      falls off. Sgt. says it's exciting going after dope. One day they get the
      dealers, the next the users. Different every day. It is now night time.
      The dealer runs and they chase him, tackle him and cuff him/He thinks it
      makes you in touch with the community by stopping them from selling crack
      to kids. Deputy Willie Washington says the biggest lie is someone driving
      through a drug area saying they are lost. They stop a driver who says just
      that. He made a wrong turn off the freeway. He says he's heard lots of
      stories about District 2 - lots of violence and shootings. He didn't want
      to work there, was scared, but now likes it because of the people, they
      are great. The Lt. stops a car. The woman says she was looking for the
      ocean. They find drugs in the car - a cocaine rock. She says it isn't
      hers, she just wanted to go home. They ask how it got there. She says a
      guy she stopped for directions must have thrown it in there. Then asks if
      they planted it. They cuff her and put her in the back of a car. She wants
      the cuffs off. The Lt. says to calm down. She won't. He says she is going
      to the station and is going to be booked. If she didn't do it, tell the
      judge and if he believes it she'll be free. He reads her rights from a
      card. She can't believe he has a card. At the station they book her. He is
      really nice to her about it. She says again and again she can't believe
      there was a rock in the car and is totally embarrassed. Deputy Linda
      Canada is doing paperwork in a diner with her fiancé Deputy Jerry Wurms. They kiss.
      (11:31 PM 911 Call) She
      leaves to a call of a mother Nancy and her daughter who want her boyfriend
      not to come back. The daughter cries and says she doesn't want him back.
      There is also a 22 month old running around. He comes back and the
      daughter screams. She wants to go to a hospital because she doesn't want
      to stay there since she is scared of him and is only 7 years old. He is
      arrested and wants the girlfriend to call his mom. Linda talks to the 7
      year old and says he got drunk and almost hit her. She wants him to stay
      in jail first for 2 nights, then 4 nights, 10 nights - forever since she
      is scared of him. They give him a trespass warning, he can't come back
      again. She says he is a good man when he isn't on drugs, cocaine or
      whatever. Linda says she needs to make up her mind, but will take the
      children if she doesn't provide a safe environment for them. Linda leaves
      and the girl wants to go with her. She promises to come back tonight and
      tomorrow. Linda wants to take her out of the house, but most likely he'll
      be back tomorrow since he is the breadwinner and she is scared to be alone
      in the bad neighborhood and the girl will want him out again. #101.

      talks
      to a shirtless man who says his bicycle was stolen, but doesn't want
      to press charges. A fat white guy nearby
      in a dirty white shirt says he had nothing to do with it. The shirtless guy won't shut
      up or listen, so he
      gets arrested. Linda goes on a boat ride with her fiancé Jerry Wurms, they only
      have one day a week off together. They picked out an engagement ring, but
      haven't bought it yet so she goes to visit it. That night he asks her to
      marry him and has the ring. She says yes and they go to a
      restaurant. The next day the Sgt. announces their engagement and they goof
      on her. She goes to a call to search a women under arrest for drugs. She
      gloves up and makes her take off her shoes. She's on crack
      and is bruised all over her legs, saying she was beat. Linda asks if she
      ever tried to get help and she'll put her in a program if she is
      willing. She can't promise, it's hard, she has no one, is a prostitute,
      scared of being raped, can't stop. She moves her to another car. (Roll Call)
      District 2 - Lt. Robert Rios asks how many people check the backseats of
      their cars. He found a bag of crack in the couch in the lobby that someone
      stashed there. The Sgt. says they only had 3 DUI arrests so far which isn't
      acceptable. He wants 3 a day - make a deal. Deputy Willie Washington says he has to
      work Christmas, New Year's - all the holidays. He goes to a house where a
      crazy woman is sweeping. He has to grab her and make her sit down. She
      mouths off and he tells her if he has to come back she'll be arrested.
      They were fighting. because Candy threw water on the other woman and she came after her
      with a broom. It's Thanksgiving, so he's trying to be nice. The Lt.
      arrives
      and he explains it. He goes back and says one of them has to leave. Candy
      won't shut up and he yells at her that she is getting on his nerves. The
      second woman won't leave so he cuffs her. She cries in the back of his
      car. He goes back to talk to Candy and says if he
      saw her throw the chair she would go to jail too. The next time he comes
      he will arrest her as a trouble-maker. (Drug Task
      Force) Sgt. Bo Deak leads a neighborhood sweep. They hit a dozen people
      fast. One guy has drugs
      in his shoe. Another has it in his pocket, but says it is nothing. Another
      guy is stopped, the only one without coke in the area. A couple is stopped
      by a church and busted. One guy runs, is caught and still has the dope
      on him. He said he wasn't dealing anymore. A bunch more people are busted,
      then they look for drugs on the beach. They stop a guy in a red van with a dog
      and arrest him with a big bag of coke. (Search Warrant Briefing) Task
      force. It's a guy they've been to before. Last time he had four guns on
      him, but wasn't much trouble. (Warrant Served) They run in, bust him and talk to the girlfriend and ask her whom is he selling it to. She
      admits her mom sells a little bit of drugs too. He says she should leave.
      She is working, but doesn't make enough to move out. He asks where her mom
      usually keeps the crack. She shows her the medicine cabinet. He doesn't
      want her kids to pick up a crack rock, eat it and die. She cries that she
      is taking care of him. #102. 3/25/89</td>

      Willie Washington talks to students at Boyd H. Anderson high school where
      he used to teach. He says some kids that don't have role models look to
      those they see with big chains and BMWs. (Street Patrol) He's arrested 3
      of his former students and spots another and has him drop and give him 20
      pushups. If they are going to be just hanging out they need to exercise.
      He says to the students not to let him catch them dirty or he'll do what
      he has to. He drives and spots 3 black guys hanging out and has them get
      on his car. Backup comes and they check them out. One guy tries to run and
      is tackled and cuffed. The other two are also cuffed. One holds the dope
      and the other holds the money. Back in school he says dealers have no
      longevity, they don't care. 16 year olds dealing shoot people just for
      looking at them. Be careful where you go or you could get jacked. At night
      he stops a white guy in a bad area and tells him he could get jumped by 8
      or 9 guys. He points him out and says not to come back. In school he says
      they can see him now or later, but later they will be cuffed. At a
      basketball game Deputy Linda Canada watches Jerry play, says he's a good
      father to her kids and can't wait to marry him. They win 61 to 57. Later
      Linda tries on wedding dresses at the bridal shop. Prostitution Sting
      Briefing - organized crimes division. The Sgt. tells them to make sure the
      door is locked, latch it. One officer calls home, she forgot her gun and
      someone is coming to get it and she wants them to bring back her fur coat.
      The signal is when she takes an orange flower out of her hair. They do the
      stings to get rid of the street crime. Merchants don't want whores in
      front of their businesses. Linda tries to think about how the girls she
      busts walks, moves and talks and tries to imitate them. A car stops with 2
      guys who want her to do them both at the same time. Linda says he couldn't
      handle it. The guy replies, &quot;then he'll die trying.&quot; She then
      gets a car, sex for $20 and to meet at her hotel. The guy doesn't want to
      go to the hotel, he wants to do it right there. She goes around to the
      door and the cops bust him. Linda says it was fun. She has tight black
      pants and heels. Some of the guys pull up she wonders why they would do
      this. They are good looking and have jobs. Sometimes she won't even look
      at them and tries not to think about what happens to them - if it ruins
      their life or marriage. They are taken to jail. Some are given NTAs and
      some have to wait to bond out. At the next car Linda says one or both for
      $25. He pulls around to the hotel and asks a couple times where to park
      and reaches under the seat. She is nervous and has them bust him outside.
      They find a bag of coke and arrest him. It is a 2nd degree misdemeanor in
      FL for solicitation. They show the bust from the monitor and Linda laughs
      and leaves. Cops cut up plywood with a circular saw on a bench for a
      Trojan horse sting. They attach it across the back of a pickup truck and
      cover it with palm fronds and tie it down with line leaving the bottom
      open for them to hide inside. Sgt. Robert Deak says they used to cover
      foxholes with this stuff when he was a marine in Vietnam. Drug Force Task
      Briefing - next day. They spray 'Nick's Trash Pik-Up' on the side. They
      knock on the window to get their attention and a honk is the signal. One
      black guy sells them drugs and then runs. They catch him. 2nd bust catches
      two guys. 3rd bust requires them to jump out and pull their guns on a car
      who rams the police. They pull him out through the window. 4th bust is an
      older balding guy, they check his mouth and cuff him. If you are with
      someone buying crack you can get busted. They cut the passenger loose.
      Afterwards they go to a restaurant to eat. One guy is leaving the team
      after a year. He's enjoyed it a lot. They have a toast for his birthday
      and goof on Deak about wearing the pants in his family. He says he's the
      boss, then his wife comes up and surprises him. #103. 4/1/89</td>

      working out - jumping jacks, pushups, windmills. Sgt. Steve Caulfield says
      they like to think they are the elites, but some think they hare hot dogs.
      They wear camo and run through a course, crawl, run on logs, climb walls.
      Most search warrants they expect them to be armed, that's why they are
      there. They do a hostage rescue, smoke grenades, and a live fire exercise
      with Sheriff Nick Navarro. The 365-KBD plate is checked on a car they are
      going to buy from. The dealer is wearing a red shirt as they pull up to a
      strip mall, take him down and arrest him. They take him back to the
      station - he says he’s been using since age 13, did 2 years when he was
      17, 3 years at age 22 and crack is the worst drug ever. He was addicted to
      it 5 seconds after the first time. He’s also addicted to coke, heroin,
      pot 1st, alcohol, anything. He only commits crimes because of drugs, never
      had a job his whole life, gets money by conning, scamming scheming since
      he’s a scumbag. He's married, she's in Boston, has 2 kids. She left him
      because of the drugs. The area is real bad, lots of kids on the beach with
      14 year olds dealing. He cries because he wants to get his life straight.
      Deputy Linda Canada is in her car. (District 1 Street Patrol) She feels
      sorry for the whores sometimes. She stops a girl walking the street who
      says she is just going home even though she's hanging out in front of a
      saloon all the time. Linda tells her no flagging down cars or loitering
      and lets her go. She busts another woman as the husband watches. She flags
      down cars and says she needs a ride or wants to party. Linda takes her
      back at the station. She says she didn't deal and has no money. She is 33
      years old, been doing it all her life and was born in 1952. They are going
      to arrest her husband and the 2 other girls. Linda wants her to sign a
      paper against her husband. She says she won't sign something she didn't do
      and loses anyway. She says her husband battered her, she has no money and
      can't get away. She says they are making her sign it and wails and moans.
      It doesn't matter, she’s going to jail anyway. She wants to know why
      she's getting a $100,000 bond, it’s for lying. Linda doesn't feel
      anything toward these girls, they cry that they will do better, lie to the
      judge, then go back out and do it again. She stops a girl in a Guns N'
      Roses cowboy hat with buttons on it for flagging down a car. Michelle is
      19 and says she has a real job and doesn't solicit. Linda looks into her
      purse and asks when the last time she smoked crack was. Linda finds a
      mirror with coke residue on it. She doesn't have a license, but she cuts
      her loose. (2:30PM Start of Shift) Deputy Mike Hoffman is at home with his
      wife and daughter. She gets in the car and makes a siren noise. He says
      he's going to Nashville and will bring her back a shirt. She wants a green
      one, only 1 per trip. (5:45 pm Injured Animal) It's a brown dog, but seems
      to be all right. (6:03 pm Bomb Threat) They go to a restaurant and

      Russia’s national police force. An international television event,
      direct from Moscow and Leningrad. This is the reality of the men and women
      who protect and serve in the Soviet Union. (Soviet Militia Training
      Academy 6:30 AM) The commander explains what is needed to get in the
      academy. You have to be highly educated, knowledgeable in many areas,
      strong, physically prepared and often recruits don’t realize how
      difficult their course is and can’t make it through the rigorous
      training. The alarm goes off, men wake up, go to the bathrooms, wash up,
      shave and brush their teeth. Outside they run in formation on the grounds,

      (7:30 PM Leningrad) Alcoholism is a real problem, especially on national
      holidays when people want to celebrate. (May Day Celebration) They detain
      people who are drinking in public. In a park men have fallen over on the
      ground, they are pulled up and taken into a truck. Their alcoholism is a
      big problem, their role is to get them treatment for the social evil. The
      most boisterous of them go into the police van. People march in front of
      large pictures of Marx and hold up pictures of Lenin. (Drunk Tank Central
      District) The men are loaded into a cell, the sign above reads “For
      medical services provided the charge is 25 rubles.” A man is in his

      break in. They ask a little boy who walks up if he lives there, if his dad
      is there and if he has a key. He says he does, he is, but has no key. One
      cop starts kicking the door until it’s loosened. They file their way
      inside. The man says why should he open the door for them. He didn’t
      want to, his house is his fortress. They violated his house. He’s
      dressed and ready to go. They search the place and find pills. They crush
      it and dissolve it in the water. The kid climbs up on top of a cabinet and
      pulls down a bag and shows them a bottle of drugs. He’s known it a long
      time and has reported it to the police, but they didn’t respond and
      never came. At first he didn’t know what his dad was doing. He looked in
      the slit of the door and say what they were doing. They were injecting
      drugs. His parents have been divorced 7 years and his dad comes with his
      friends to turn it into a den of drug addicts. Let him be punished, maybe
      it is better for him to serve his sentence, maybe it will reform him and
      after his sentence, maybe he’ll speak to him. (Good Friday Mass
      Leningrad) People in church light many candles and chant. They go to a
      murder scene. The homicide investigator is a woman who says his brother
      killed him. There is nothing unusual about it. He used a knife. The place
      is a mess. (Interrogation of Murder Suspect) At the station he says he was
      drinking with his friends on the street. He was drinking at home with his

      into the kitchen, got a knife, came back and stabbed him (Easter Sunday)
      On holidays domestic disputes can lead to murders. A woman stabbed her
      boyfriend, there is foul play because the body was moved from the scene
      and put into bed. They talk to the woman who is older. They want her to
      tell the truth. She says she’s very tired of life, just tired, tired of
      living like this. The man is in bed and they lift him up. She cries and
      says is she getting arrested. She admits killing Nicholas. She wanted to

      lighting candles. Part 2 (Patrol Shift Begins) Leninksy District - cops
    are given orders and go out to their cars and bikes as patriotic music
    plays. A call comes to car 426 to respond to trade school #16. (Knife Fight
    a School) It's between Russian and Azerbaijanian students. Some boys from
    the republic were studying in the school and the girls are always the center
    of the fights. It's the girl or the nationality. A man says they had a dance
    in their disco and he was responsible for the music. Then he saw a fight,
    stopped the music, ran over and saw a guy on the right with a cut vein. They
    are bandaging him up and people crowd the ambulance. One kid says it's his
    friend and he wants to go with him. They ask the man how come he didn't see
    who used the knife. He was playing the music and called the ambulance. There
    were people running all over. They talk to one kid and ask him to calm down
    and what's wrong with him. Why does he have blood on his hands? He just fell
    down, right there. His arm is cut with a knife, how did it happen? He goes
    to show them, then says let me go, I'm innocent. They take him away and go
    to the hospital to check the victim. The room is all stone, like a prison.
    (Crack Down on Motorcycle Gangs) People drive fast on bikes at night. One
    blonde girl poses for the cameras. The bikes are like Honda scooters. A cop
    says it was a big group who wouldn't stop, so they chased them and forced
    them to stop at the checkpoint so they could check their IDs. A few didn't
    have licenses or ID. So their bikes are taken and they are in trouble. Some
    are drunk and are checked out. The fine is 300 rubles, loss of license for 5
    years and 2 years at a correctional labor camp. They ask a man why he ran
    away from the cops. He felt like it and the cops are full of crap. They
    check a woman and she says not to touch her. They aren't, they just want to
    see her ID. One girl has a long tail attached to her helmet. She won't
    cooperate and they take her away. She had no license plate or ID. At the
    station they tell her to put her keys down, but she won't. They go to take
    her to jail and she fights them. She wraps her extending keychain around her
    arm and refuses to let them have them. She struggles and they say she won't
    get away and if they have her keys they are guaranteed she won't get away.
    They have her empty her coat and put her in a cell. (Rooftop Surveillance of
    Suspicious Cars) Cops climb up stairs and have walkie talkies so they can
    report down to the street. Other cops go down. Some stay and use binoculars.
    They check on a car that has been parked for 90 minutes. As they pull up
    they people put on their lights. They go and ask for their ID. It is a
    little blue car with a large Bosch sticker on the front, two big cracks on
    the windshield and a woman driver who won't come out. They lock the doors
    and won't let them in, it happens often. She drives off and two cops jump on
    her car until she stops. They ask her what right does she have to drive with
    two cops on her car. She says don't yell at me, she won't give her keys, you
    have no right. He says he has every right, she has resisted the police. She
    is obligated to show her ID to the police when they ask. She won't come out
    or give up her keys, so one cop gets in and makes her drive to the police
    station. Then they go to the house of prostitute who picks up men to rob
    them and serve her a warrant. There is a man there with no shirt in his
    underwear who says he's been working and takes them to the woman sleeping in
    the back. They tell her to get up and come with them. She says to film her
    and thanks them, they are doing lots of things to people, she is talking the
    truth, they want to steal from her and do what they want, either way she is
    going to jail, she will tell everything. She is naked and wants to get
    dressed. The man is proud of a painting he has by Restnatov of a woman and
    girls at a table. She combs her hair and says this is goodbye for good, how
    can she trust them, it's not possible, she can't trust anyone. She cries and
    goes back and gets her jacket and the cops are very patient. He says they
    are taking her away and will bring her back, not to worry. He's so tired,
    has no job. On the way down in the elevator she passes out. They say to get
    her some water, tell her to get on her feet and help her up, she can walk
    and take her to the station. She admits what she has done was not very nice,
    it was the first time it happened to her, she is afraid no court will want
    to hear her case. She had no judgment of her own caution when she visited a
    house, stole money and is ashamed to have to look into the face of the man
    she stole from. They put her in a dark stone cell. (2:00 AM Officers
    Off-Duty) Cops sit and cook huge shishkabobs on an open fire in a field
    while one of them sits on a log and plays a small acoustic guitar and sings
    Russian songs. They sing along to the second verse: &quot;We may not drive
    fancy cars, but you can not get away from us. If you are thinking of
    committing a crime you better stay out of our way. If you are thinking of
    committing a crime you better stay out of our way.&quot; They keep singing
    as the credits roll. AKA Former Soviet Union #114. 6/17/89</td>
