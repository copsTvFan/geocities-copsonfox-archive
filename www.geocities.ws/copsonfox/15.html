      they are married he won't start that and she'll always win. There is a
      traffic stop at a hotel. The driver is Scott who is very manly, but is

      says she was going to take him home, but he didn't know her. Scott drops

      back in the car. Adam says he's known her for three months, but doesn't
      know her name. He doesn't know Scott is a man. They don't believe his
      story and know they just met. They show him Scott's license listing him as
      a male. He says, “Oh wow!&quot; They ask if he wants a cab because he
      could've gotten robbed or worse, but he wants to ride with Scott. Scott
      gets a failure to yield ticket for $53. He lives out of state and they
      will pick him up because of the way he's dressed. They've seen it before
      where a guy pretending to be a woman takes someone home and there are
      fights and stabbings. (Miami, FL - 9:35 PM Street Patrol) North District -
      Officer Rick Martinez started going to college to be a lawyer then decided
      he wanted to be on the other side catching the guys. He applied and that
      was 12 years ago. An area called Edison is a high drug area and it's hard
      to catch dealers because of the narrow alleys they run in and hide. He
      spots a big black guy, Jerome, in an American flag doorag and gives chase.
      They corner him so he gives up. They cuff him, arrest him. And find crack
      cocaine nearby. He's got a Jamaican accent and says he ran because he was
      scared and the drugs aren't his. A guy was fighting with his girlfriend
      and she put his clothes in the garbage can. He says the drugs aren't his,
      but he's been arrested for possession before. Rick asks what's up with him
      tossing the drugs like a football right in front of him. Jerome wants to
      know what he's being charged with. His story doesn't make sense, if he's
      in a fight why is he running toward her. He says he ran because he thought
      his girlfriend called the cops. If you have more than three bags on you
      it's possession with intent to sell and he has 15 bags on him. He keeps
      saying it's not his. He knows the game and will probably be back on the
      streets tomorrow doing the same thing. #1528. 7/19/03</td>
