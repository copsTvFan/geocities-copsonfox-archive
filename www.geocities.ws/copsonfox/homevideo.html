nothing else until 2003 when some were released on VHS/DVD with too hot footage.
Then nothing until 2008 when the 20th anniversary special was released.&nbsp;</p>

      <b>Too Hot Footage</b><br>
      Biker Patrol - a woman shakes her ass.<br>
      Sturgis 97 - women show their breasts. One on top of the crowd has hairy
      pits, one's thongs rides high. Lady Godiva is a girl with thong on the
      back of a bike. Cops say they are looking for open containers, exhibition
      driving and burnouts. A woman flashes on the back of a bike and stops for
      pictures. Cops bust her then a woman in a red thong poses for pictures.
      #1036<br>
      The right to remain silent - Ken the shaved head lunatic.<br>
      Palm Springs, CA - The very hard looking ugly woman says she's just
      BBQing and goes to turn over the meat. She won't listen, won't come over,
      asks what she did, wants to know again. He says to get her ID before he
      becomes really impatient. She says he already has, hasn't he? He says not
      yet. She says it'll take a second and goes inside and says should she get
      her gun first? She calls him a rookie and an a-hole. #1507<br>
      A guy with a shaved head and a long pony tail says he'll bust his f--king
      head. He'll press charges on him for being a f--king asshole, playing
      goddamn godzilla, but he's a bitch. They'll rough him up downtown and
      he'll make it come back to him. Just a punk pussy behind the badge. They
      aren't men, they are bitches. He's white and he's right.<br>
      An old white guy in the street says don't get f--king hostile. They cuff
      him and he says don't f--king talk to me, his son says if you kill me I'll
      f--king sue your ass. The old guy says don't be yelling at me.<br>
      A black woman says to a guy her momma called her on the phone and she told
      him to get out of her f--king house. He's not her sister, Anita is. She
      knows him, but she's not his boyfriend.<br>
      Des Moines, IA - The woman with the tire iron says don't f--king push me. The daughter says
      the Asian woman is a f--king asshole, they asked him if he had a f--king
      problem and he punched her mom 6 f--king times. The gooks are all sticking
      together. She says he f--king hit her first, what kind of man is that. All
      these f--king gooks won't tell the truth. No one will f--king listen to
      her because she's pissed. #1410<br>
      Don was asleep, he woke up to her yelling, she's been yelling all f--king
      day because she's on the rag.<br>
      The white guy from before says he's no tough guy, but he'd like to
      headbutt their asses right out. They say to try it. He makes a move, says
      he could've done it, would've knocked him right out. Then he butts his
      head on the car and calls them pussy boy.<br>
      The drunk old guy from before says he doesn't know what he's been arrested
      for. He says get off his ass, he doesn't give a f--k, they are a bunch of
      punk mofos anyway. The only crime is your mouth, f--k you and your momma.
      He doesn't know where his teeth is. Where's your teeth he says, up your
      momma's ass?<br>
      The BBQ Meat girl says you are an a-hole, when I grow up I want to be just
      like you. He's just a smart guy a-hole, are you still a rookie? She
      doesn't have knives, cigarettes, calls him a-hole Larson<br>
      White guy says he'll take them to the gym and box their assess and break
      their f--king necks.<br>
      The old guy struggles and says you do what you gotta do, he doesn't care
      what the f--k you gotta do, you eat your mommas pussy and ass. Punch me in
      the face, I don't give a f--k.<br>
      A crazy guy in the back of a car says I ain't got a mofoing thing to say
      to you, I don't give a f--k if it's hot. He's not a mofo stoner. He's
      driving around in a station wagon that doesn't look tough. Yeah, it's a
      piece of sh-t, but he's still mofoing hard.<br>
      Old guy says I bet you are a big old dick eater and that's a suck my dick
      camera.<br>
      The white guy loaded into a paddywagon. He says I'll see you later bitch
      and yells it. He's going to stomp their mofo ass, you're a homosexual mofo.<br>
      Hazardous Duty - Cops chase a guy into the brush, take him down, he bites
      a cops arm and growls wearing only stained underwear. A cops nose is all
      bloody from where he punched him. He says he's fine when he gets up.<br>
      A cops chases a guy on a motorcycle. He stops, gets out and tackles him
      off the bike.<br>
      A woman fights with a female bike cop. They pound each other until they
      pull her off.<br>
      Palm Beach, FL - Deputy Shawn Boorman says if he throws it he's under arrest, it's a crack
      pipe. No it isn't. You can't outrun the one legged guy? I let you catch
      me. #1123<br>
      Two guys fight at an airport, chaos ensues and they tackle them and cuff
      them.<br>
      A guy in his house fights like crazy. A woman wants him out, he flies
      through the air, says if they kill me he's going to come back and get you.
      It takes 3 of them to hold him down. He screams that they grabbed his neck
      and he wants their badge numbers.<br>
      A woman trespassing in a yard says go to hell and trespass. He takes the
      beer away from her and pushes her down and cuffs her. She says oh really
      she's under arrest? She struggles the whole time.<br>
      A Mexican guy dressed as a woman has crack in his mouth and tries to
      swallow it. They grab his neck and he keeps squealing &quot;I don't have
      nothing&quot; Then his large wig comes off. He says he's telling the
      truth. #1230</td>

      Hello, I'm John Langley, executive producer of Cops. Over the years
      we've filmed a variety of police activities, but certainly the most
      exciting and the most dangerous is the high speed pursuit, it's the kind
      of activity that gives cops nightmares. Here's an example of what we mean
      as we join Cops In Hot Pursuit. (Kansas City, MO - 1:04 AM Car Chase)

      down and shakes. EMS waters him down. He backs people up and FD goes in.
      He's burnt pretty bad, they say second degree, never saw anything like
      that before. They put him on a stretcher with an IV. Hang tight man. He
      says there is an old man in the basement, anyone inside? It's something

      life.<br>

      touching the floor where his ladder fell over. How long has he been there?
      It usually takes and hour or more to get to that form. They aren't too
      sure it's a suicide. Sgt. Mark Walker says see how his tongue is, that's
      what they look for in hanging cases. The struggle and pressure, that's
      from hanging, if there is none that means he was hung after he was killed.
      The ropes stretch, he thrashed around a little bit, painful, he didn't go
      like that, flopped around a few minutes. #334<br>
      Hoboken, NJ - Officer Mike Plunkett says you never know who you are going

      that's my woman, give her some clothes. She gets up, has floppy misshaped
      breasts and shows it all off, then bends over the trunk. Where are her
      clothes? You better get some on or you are going to jail. They throw a
      coat on her and she curses them out. They find a dress and cuff her and
      put her in a van. The job is full of surprises, never know what you are
      going to run in. 6:45am obviously needs some mental help. Her husband says
      she's never gotten any before, obviously she has problems.<br>
      Kodiak, AK - Sgt. John Palmer goes to Breaker's Bar where a drunk woman
      left woman left the ships bar and then went into another bar to drink and
      that's a felony charge. They get Lucy into the car and have to carry her

      pounds on the window and will go through. They have to go in and a large

      told it happened in front of the drug house. His car is all shot up. A
      black guy is in the front all bloody and leaning over, he's spitting blood
      and twitching, but they say he's DOA. The car is full of buckshot, windows
      are blown out, it's definitely from the crack house, coroner is on the
      way.<br>

      into the pole. He's OK, the other person in the car they pull out with a
      leg hanging off. Another DWI, he thinks he's going to get away with it,
      but is never going to talk to his buddy again.<br>
      Las Vegas, NV - Cops run and yell do you have him? They catch a hairy
      naked man and he is yelling nonsense. They tell him to spread his feet,
      stop resisting, relax. He says they knocked me out, GD, MF ahole. It makes
      it real difficult when they are under the influence and there is nothing
      to grab on to.<br>
      Pierce County WA - Deputy Anthony Jensen says it looks like the suspect shot
      himself, coming up on the right. They go into the house and EMS works on
      someone. Does he have a weapon. There is a baby shot dead in a crib, black

      the pictures. The wife is down and dead. The shooter's arm is in a cast.
      Once he shot her he shot the 2 kids, then himself, that's where they heard

      so they could be together. #445<br>
      Pittsburgh, PA - Officer Pat Logan says you wonder why policemen shoot
      themselves in the head. How would you like to see this day in day out. 28
