      undercover says he spotted guys selling drugs across from a park out of a
      car and have bought from them before, but Greg got robbed last time, so
      make sure they have their signals down. They've been working the area for
      a while and have really cleaned it up of coke, but if they don't keep it
      up it'll come back. (9:08 PM Sting Operations) Officer Greg Damarian is at
      a 7-11 in a truck. He is in the passenger seat and two guys approach to
      sell him a rock. Greg wants to make sure it's real and the dealer says
      he's Cuban, it's always real. Another guy approaches looking for a piece
      of rock. They say they don't have enough and he wants some money to score.
      They call in the description to the cops on bikes who take them down. This
      way they don't blow the undercover guys. (9:56 PM) They go to a bar on
      Charleston St. with lots of cocaine traffic. Officer Janice Kashiwamura is
      in the passenger seat when they pull up. A white guy comes over and says
      to pull over by the white truck. The dealer tells them to have a beautiful
      day. They ask him if there is enough there for both of them. He says yeah,
      but not too much to keep them wrecked all night. He says he's got weed
      too. She wants to know if it's good then can they find him there again. He
      says to look for him there when they drive by and shakes their hand. They
      leave and the bike group swarms on him and he runs. The catch him with
      their truck and he spits out the bags of dope and his retainer. He says
      he's sorry, he has had problems. (4:39 PM Street Patrol) NLV PD - Officer
      Sue Schaaf has been there 8 years and has problems with huffers - paint
      sniffers. She spots a known offender, Marcus, who hides the evidence in
      his pocket. She gets out and cuffs him and he has paint all over him. He
      threw a can in a yard and has a gold can of paint in his pocket and the
      ticket he got from police yesterday in his pocket. She asks why he keeps
      doing this. This is the 4th ticket he's gotten in a week in a half, but
      the jail won't take him. Officer Dave Acosta comes up to translate. He
      says he sniffs a can of paint a day. Marcus's mom shows up only speaking
      Spanish. She says he sniffs at least a can of day and his memory is so
      shot he can't remember his own phone number. It fries your brain worse
      than narcotics. They are taking him to jail in hopes they keep him there.
      He doesn't care if his mom wants to help him. He doesn't eat, but doesn't
      want to die. They are trying to build a case to get him help. (9:10 PM
      Domestic Disturbance) North East Area Command - Officer Keith Harris says
      the majority of his calls are domestic, loud parties with the occasional
      homicide. You can be talking to someone one second and the next someone
      comes after you with a knife. He pulls up to a house where 3 people are
      outside and a woman is crying. She wants Norton arrested so he cuffs him.
      Robin is his fiancé, keeps crying and is pregnant, so they cuff her. He
      says he fought with his mom and his mom went to hit him with a stick and
      he pulled it out of her hand. Mom says John's selling vacuum cleaners and
      not making any money, so he’s upset and she let them live with her. He's
      moving all around with no place to stay. He bought $20 in groceries and
      somebody ate some and he bitched about it. She put down $1300 on a car and
      he lost his job at Little Caesars and can't pay. She pays all the bills,
      $1400 a month, and he doesn't do anything and just doesn't get it. He is
      18, moved out and moved back. He says they argued over the food he bough
      and has an anger problem. The reason they cuffed him is it's a domestic
      situation and they don't come off until the situation is under control.

      He's part of a small unit in such a large dept. They go to precincts with
      major problems in robberies, shooting and homicide and try to bring those
      numbers down. He was born in the ghetto, South Bronx, brought up in the
      hood, sees a lot of things, lots of guys he grew up with are in jail, some
      are dead or haven't made it anywhere. One of the few things he remembers
      as a kid was when the cops came down into the neighborhood and how they
      would actually clean up the neighborhood and he said 'hey when I get out
      of here one of the things I want to do is become a cop. I want to go out
      there, come back to the neighborhood that I was born in and do the same
      thing maybe plus times.' They ride under the L train and see three kids in
      a car weaving in traffic and follow them for a while. The cops get out and
      the kids have the radio blasting. One of them tries to run and Joey's
      partner cuffs him. Another has a gun and they order him down and cuff him
      as backup arrives. (4:11 AM Burglary Call) Cops go the scene and then
