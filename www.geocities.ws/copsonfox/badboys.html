<h3 align="center"><a name="#lyr">Lyrics</a> </h3>

<p align="left">Lyrics to the theme song by reggae group by
    Inner Circle. There are three versions. The pilot
episode is the only one to have the full song, the lyrics below are the most common 1 
minute intro and the 30 second intro version used in reruns is just the chorus. The 
first season listed the members of Inner Circle in the
    credits. They released music video for 'Bad Boys' in 1993 that incorporated Cops footage. In 1993 the song won a Grammy Award and
in 1999 singer Calton Coffie wrote a sequel called
&quot;Ruffa Than U&quot;.</p>

<p align="left"><b>30 second version (Used for the last few years)</b><br>
Huh! Bad boys<br>
Whatcha want, whatcha want, whatcha gonna do<br>

Bad boys, bad boys<br>
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do<br>
When they come for you!</p>

<p align="left"><b>1 minute version (on older reruns)</b><br>
Huh! Bad boys<br>
Whatcha want, whatcha want, whatcha gonna do<br>
When sheriff John Brown come for you<br>
Tell me whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna dooo<br>
Yeah yeah</p>

<p align="left"> 
Bad boys, bad boys<br>
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do<br>
When they come for you<br>
Bad boys, bad boys<br>
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do<br>
When they come for you!<br>
<br>
Nobody now give you no break<br>

No old soldier now give you no break<br>
Not even you idren now give you no break<br>
Hey hey<br>
<br>
Bad boys, bad boys<br>
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do<br>
When they come for you<br>
Bad boys, bad boys<br>
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do<br>
When they come for you!</p>

<p align="left"><b>Long version from the Pilot episode - except for the 'chuck it'
verse<br>
</b>Huh!
Bad boys whatcha want, whatcha want, whatcha gonna do&nbsp;<br>
When the sheriff John Brown come for you&nbsp;<br>
Tell me whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do<br>
Yeah!</p>

<p>Bad boys,&nbsp; bad boys<br>
Watcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do
when they come for you<br>
(repeat)</p>
<p>When you were eight and you had bad traits<br>
You go to school and you learn the golden rule<br>
So why are you acting like a bloody fool<br>
If you get hot! You must get cool</p>
<p>Chorus</p>
<p>You chuck it on that one<br>
You chuck it on this one<br>
You chuck it on your mother and<br>
You chuck it on your father<br>
You chuck it on your brother and<br>
You chuck it on your sister<br>
You chuck it on that one and you chuck it on me</p>
<p>Chorus</p>
<p>Nobody now give you no break<br>
Police now give you no break<br>
No old soldier now give you no break<br>
Not even your idren now give you no breaks</p>
<p>Chorus<br>
Break</p>
<p>Why did you have to act so mean?<br>
Don't you know you're a human being?<br>
Born of a mother with the love of a father&nbsp;<br>
Reflections comes and reflections goes<br>
I know sometimes you want to let go<br>
Hey, hey, hey!<br>
I know sometimes you want to let go</p>
<p>Chorus<br>
You're too bad...<br>
You're too rude...<br>
(repeat)<br>
Chorus<br>
Bad boys...bad boys...(4x)</p>

<p align="center"> 
<a href="images/badboysmv01.jpg" target="_blank">Opening shot with title</a></p>

<p align="left"> 
The video is 3:46 from 1993. It opens with a shot of Cops playing on a TV in the
street. Shots of the group are shown with each member in black and white in the
dark and someone shining a light on them. Three guys walk on the street in color
which mixes with shots of the band in color playing a concert. Shots alternate
from clips of Cops on the TV to the band in B/W, playing live and the three
guys. One of the guys climbs up a rafter as the band walks around. The guy gets
down, a girl with long braided brown hair dances around the street, the guys run
for it and fight, cops pull up by the guys and one of the guys climbs a fire escape.
Clips alternate with the girl, the band, TV clips and the kid. Near the end the
singer shines a light into the crowd at the concert. B/W shots of the band
walking away.</p>

<p align="left">Clips include:<br>
1. #526 - Officer Rick Benson kicks over a blue kiddie pool.<br>
2. #5?? - Officer Matt Smith kicks in a door.<br>

4. #5?? - San Bernardino Deputy in his car.<br>

7. #525 - cops check a man in a tie died shirt.<br>
8. #321? - Hoboken NJ - Officer Mike Plunkett high fives a black prisoner
through a jail cell.<br>
Clips too fast to ID - man kicking in a white door, car racing down the street,
handcuffs on a suspect, two cops in yellow jackets lifting a cuffed white girl
up off the ground, 2 young white guys in white shirts being searched and cuffed,
black man hopping in a police station and three cops pinning him to a wall, man
at gunpoint going on the ground, K9 jumping through a window, black man in white
jogging suit running down the street, undercover cops run across a lawn to catch
a suspect (one in a white shirt, one in a yellow shirt), a group of cops in
yellow police shirts run into a house (Boston?), cops drag a man wearing a white
shirt and suspenders into a jail cell, a cell door closes and a police car on
the street from above.</p>
