      Officer Mike Souder takes the call. Casey says he was toilet papering his
      tree and a Glen came out and punched him in the face. So he drove off and
      Glen jumped in and broke off his gearshift. He says he stopped smoking
      weed, but they find some weed in the car. Glen has no shirt on and says he
      grabbed the drive and put it in park. He started to pull away while he was
      hanging inside. The kid tried to crash him into a truck and he punched him
      in the face and broke the drive shaft. The woman says they peed on her
      truck, but the kids deny it. They have surveillance cameras on the outside
      of their house so the cops go inside to check the tape. The son was inside
      asleep. The driver is seen peeing on the car tire while the girl toilet
      papers the truck. They go back out and Casey finally admits he peed and
      the drugs were his. He gets charged with battery, possession and urinating
      in public. Sgt. Loren Napier says he could've killed Glen. Mike tells him
      it was bad idea to grab on the guys truck because they have it on tape.
      Little Rock, AR (7:04 PM Disturbance Call) Officer Jeff Holt is going to
      backup another cop at a disturbance and doesn't know what is going on.
      Officer Matt Murski goes up to the house and they can hear screaming
      outside. A 50 year-old lady says her 90 year-old friend stabbed her
      because she has the devil in her. The woman has a cut on her arm for no
      reason. The 90 year-old says the 50 year-old got mad, started with her,
      she was defending herself and stabbed her before she could stab her first.
      The 90 year-old says the woman keeps carrying on about her punk son. Sgt.
      Heath Helton arrives. They both were probably drinking and the 90 year-old
      is arrested for battery. She wants the 50 year-old out and can't find the
      key so they have to call the housing authority. The wound wasn't deep. Las
      Vegas, NV (8:50 AM Stolen Vehicle) Metropolitan PD South East Area Command

      12:46 PM Suspicious Person) Southwest Policing District - Officer Joey
      Perez grew up in the small town of Reedly, no drugs or gangs - a good,
      small community. His dad was a cop and taught him moral character which no
      one teaches people that in this town and that is the problem. He spots a
      woman walking who headed the other way when she saw him coming. He asks if
      she has anything. Barbara is a fat, heavy white woman who says just a
      compact, then a lighter, makeup and cigarettes. Then she admits she has 2
      crack pipes, but they are his, not hers. A train comes right by them and
      she starts bawling like a baby, doesn't want to go to jail and admits she
      smoked crack an hour ago. She freaks out, because cops make her nervous.
      Then she tries to run and Joey jumps on her. He threatens to taser her if
      she doesn't behave so she stops and is cuffed. A big chunk of crack fell
      out of her compact when she threw it. They also find dope she threw. Then
      she won't tell her name, she didn't resist, is 17 years old, pregnant and
      wants to see Sgt. Pat Jackson. Pat says she doesn't look pregnant. She
      says she hasn't had her period in 4 months, but no doctor confirmed it.
      She doesn't care about the kid, wants to die, kill herself, is 17 weeks
      pregnant and her arm and leg hurts. Pat says they have had contact with
      her before and she is always combative and sarcastic. When they pick up
      her crack pipe a cockroach leg falls out. Pierce County WA – Lakewood
      (10:47 PM Vehicle Crash) Officer Joe Kolp says it’s a business area, few
      taverns, really busy, bars are full. A car went through the back of a 7-11
      into the office. Vivian the fat Mexican woman who owns the car says she
      was in the club and doesn't know what happened. The witness said the car
      sped through the lot, hit a man and then crashed. They say it was a female
      driver, but didn't see her. He was hit hard enough to flip through the
      air, they drove away so they went in and told the store-owner. They admit
      after they are told they could be held for obstruction if the Mexican
      woman was driving. Officer Rodger Leach questions her. Vivian cries and
      won't admit she was driving, then finally admits she drove the car and hit
      her boyfriend who left. She wasn't drinking. He jumped out of the car when
      they were arguing. She put the car in reverse and hit him by hitting the
      gas by mistake. She was scared, has two kids at home and is arrested for
      obstruction by lying at first and now is in a heap of trouble. San
      Bernardino County CA - Rancho Cucamonga PD. Deputy Joe Braaten has been with
      Sheriff's Dept for over 6 years and wanted a career that was challenging
      and different every day. Other jobs didn't do it for him. He did a couple
      ride alongs with buddies and liked it. (12:32 AM Traffic Stop) He pulls
      over a car that has month old expired tags. Angela the driver says it's in
      the mail and has a pot pipe right in plain sight. He asks her how much
      weed she smoked tonight. She says none. He says she is lying. She says she
      doesn't have any pot in the car and wasn't smoking it. He checks her eyes
      and she's stoned. The pipe is next to a bag of cookies and there is a meth
      pipe too. She says there is nothing else that she knows off. He keeps
      looking and finds a speed straw. Deputy Scott Gould backs him up. She
      admits to him she used it a few hours ago. It was her first time in a
      while. He arrests her to wake her up since she has no previous arrests, no
      job and still lives at home. He tells her this stuff will destroy her and
      she seems like a nice person. She cries. (Fox Mistakenly Lists this as Bad
