      guy says he's allowed to honk all night in this country. No one got hurt,
      so it's all good. Forth Worth, TX (9:05 PM) East Division - Officer Sean
      Blaydes says being a cop is a pretty fun job, lots of leeway, can do as
      little or as much as you want with no boss breathing down your neck. Some
      days have nothing, some are constant. Officer Tegan Broadwater tries to
      take nothing home and tell no stories, but his wife keeps hitting him up
      for information though he likes to keep it on the street. They pull a
      woman over and she digs through a pile of papers. They ask what she is
      doing. She was visiting her friend Cassandra on Rosedale and Hemphill,
      hasn't been anywhere else. She hasn't stopped anywhere even though they
      saw her. They pull her out and she keeps pulling her lip up showing her
      teeth. They search her pockets and all she has is a phone number. Then she
      says she stopped at another friends house since she is a stripper and has
      a lot of friends and thinks they are messing with her. She says she has a
      point and a spoon in the car and is willing to get naked if they want
      since she does it for a living. She pulled a muscle in her leg and needs
      help to sit. They find a bag of needles and a spoon. She says she gets
      high after work, only spends $20 a day and used to spend $300 a day. She
      rambles on and on about her mom and going to court for not having
      headlights. She got off at 7:30pm, went to a house and shot up at
      Cassandra's. They find some unused drugs. She just got out of jail for
      heroin, now she's going back. Forth Worth, TX (12:02 AM) North Division -
      Officer Ernesto Tamayo II works with the CCRT unit, Crime Response Team,
      whatever tasks they give them they deal with. He grew up on the east side,
      joined the Air Force, didn't think about being a cop, just ended up there.
      He pulls up behind two guys about to drag race. He thinks they are going
      to call it off and they race anyway. He turns on the lights as they speed
      off and he gets the first guy to pull over and the second guy soon after.
      He thinks the Camero is going to u-turn and run on him, but he stays put.
      Ernesto tells them he was right behind him and they didn't see him. Alvin
      in the Ford is 39 and says the guy in the Camero was teasing him the whole
      way. Ernesto admits he saw him taunting him and he fell for it. The guy in
      the Camero is 25 and says he wasn't breaking the speed limit and he wasn't
      racing. Ernesto laughs. First guy and says he was having fun, but this
      isn't the place, someone could get killed. The Camero guy didn't mean no
      harm. Ernesto says if these lose control they could wipe someone out.
      Alvin says he was playing catch up, he would've caught him. He gives them
      tickets and says they have raceways they can take it to. They should've
      looked in their rearview at least before they do something stupid. #1428.

      Burglary in Progress) District 2 - MPO Robert Newberry decided to get into
      law enforcement when he was five. He was working at a racetrack that his
      dad was part owner of and one day his dad saved him from a wild race car
      making all this noise and he took off running and he grabbed him and he
      always looked up to him for that. Two black men were seen trying to steal
      tires off a car in a dealership on the main road. They find one hiding
      under a red car as the K9 looks for the second one. They all run down the
      road and catch him in a parking lot. The guy screams, wails and cried to
      god he didn't do it and only ran because he was scared. He said he needed
      the money or else they would kill him, but he doesn't know them and was
      just holding the tools. Ft. Worth, TX (4:07 PM Suspicious Activity)
      Officer J.R. Mendoza talks about how he is still going to college. He sees
      a car sitting alone under a bridge alone in a known drug area. He goes
      above it on the overpass and looks down and sees a woman in a blue pickup
      truck using a needle. He and Maldanado go down and bust her and her
      husband Barnet of three years is the driver. She says her shoulder is

      and he is getting arrested and she cries, pleads and says it is hers. San

      AM Car Pursuit) East Division - Officer Brian Clark enjoys working the
      midnight shift. When the call load goes down he can be more proactive and
      it looks for things. The shift works out because when he's going home his
      2 and 4 year old are waking up so he can play with them. Fortunately for
      his son and daughter they got his wife's good looks and not his chiseled
      features. A car runs a stop sign at Ave K and he chases him until he bails
      at Ave L. They get out, but don't go far and he holds two Mexican men at
      gunpoint and tells them to get on the ground. The passenger has trouble
      listening, the driver doesn't come out and another passenger ran away. A
      woman comes out of the house they pulled into and wants to know what's
      going on. Brian tells them they ran from the police. The driver says he
      ran because he didn't want his father's car to get towed and he doesn't
      have a license. Brian says it will get towed now and all he would've
      gotten was a ticket. The guy in the orange pants lives there, the driver
      doesn't. He's been to jail before and says the car isn't stolen and he
      almost wiped out on the last turn. The new law in Texas is that if you run
      from the police it's a felony. They find a Coke can filled with paint in
      the car and the driver says he knows the paint is bad, he's not in a gang
      and knew better than to run. San Bernardino, CA (5:57 AM Traffic Stop)
      Deputy Phil Dupper works in the unincorporated part of town where there
      are no lights, two people on horses and lots of yards on the streets. He
      pulls over a bashes up, dirty truck for not having a license plate light.
      He says he lives right there and has no license. Phil wants him to take it
      easy. Fred is a white guy with a purple doorag who gets all wiry when he
      gets out. He cuffs him and searches him. He asks him why he's doing this,
      his son is probably watching him. He says he did nothing wrong, has
      nothing, but he finds speed on him. He says he's working on getting his
      license and he hasn't had a license for 10 years. His truck is dirty from
      working. He finds a bit of weed in the truck. Phil finds it interesting
      that Fred has a D.A.R.E. shirt on since he’s sending the wrong message.
      The Sgt. backs him up. Fred can't believe he is getting arrested, he did
      nothing wrong. Phil asks about the shirt, he says it's a hand me down
      shirt he uses for work, he's a bricklayer, he doesn't know. He's been
      using for a few years, trying to quit. Tampa, FL (11:55 PM Suspicious
      Vehicle) District 2 - Cpl Todd Lunge talks about a call he once took for a
      domestic with several brothers having a party. One had a bat and he
      screamed, threw the bat down, it hit the ground, bounced back up and hit
      him in the head knocking him out, so he was easy to arrest. He spots a red
      pick up truck parked in a known drug area. He pulls up and there is a
      woman in a designer bowler hat sleeping on the front seat. A window is
      open and a door is unlocked so he opens it and shakes her. She says let
      go, asks what he's doing and says she's fine. He asks if she knows who he
      is. She says an officer of the law and she was sleeping and doesn't know
      if there are drugs in there. A guy was giving her a ride home and she fell
      asleep. Todd spots a Brillo pad and she says nothing in the truck is hers
      even though there's a pocketbook with woman's clothes and gold shoes. She
      says it's not hers. Backup arrives and he says it's Signal 10 and puts her
      in the back of his car. The guy she was with is a black guy with a
      mustache and no name. In the bag he finds a prescription bottle with her
      name on it and cocaine inside. He also finds a crack pipe. Todd goes back
      and reads her rights. The truck is stolen and she says the prescription is
      not hers and she doesn't have a crack pipe. He says right, he has it now
      and he'll dump her clothes since they aren't hers. They can't prove she
      stole the truck, so she'll get trespassing. #1433. 9/21/02</td>
