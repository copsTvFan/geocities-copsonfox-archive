      again and again. She says he put it in the shed. Damon says to go look so
      they bring in a K9 and find a tin of pot out there. Damon says it is hers
      and she said it was in the shed, but it was behind the shed and he gave
      permission to search the shed only. He has to sign an affidavit and
      apologizes for sounding indifferent. They say no problem. Fort Myers, FL
      (10:54 PM Traffic Stop) North District - Officer Greg Hemberger moved down
      there from New York 7 years ago. When you think you've seen it all,
      something different occurs, it's fun and busy. He spots a light green
      Buick parked in a drug area. He drives off and Greg pulls him over. He is
      stuffing something as he pulls over, but is all jovial when questioned. He
      produces a license, registration and insurance as 4 cops surround him.
      They pull him out and cuff him. Deputy Brian Phillips finds a bag of crack
      in the car. The driver says he asked a black guy directions to Martin
      Luther and he threw it in the car. His license is suspended and he is only
      supposed to drive to work. He says he was dropping off paperwork at his
      home office. He doesn't come down there at all, doesn't know where he's at
      and lives in Cape Coral. He gets off work at 5pm, shouldn't be there, he
      will get charged for narcotics, they’ll impound his car, seize it and
      sell it. They find roach clips in his ashtray and ashes that test positive
      for pot. He says the roaches are wire connectors and has 1000s of them at
      work. Brain says there's no way the black guy threw drugs in his ashtray
      so he's going to jail. #933. 6/21/97</td>
