      Assistance Call) A code 3 call comes in. Sgt. Larry Wilens responds to it
      on 46th street. The suspect is barricaded. Officers tried to serve a
      warrant to 63 year-old Kenneth Lynn and he shot at police twice through
      the door, but missed them. (Tactical Team Briefing) Deputy Chief Doug
      Smith says they asked Ken to come out to talk to him for neighborhood
      problems – smell and trash. They are trying to make contact with him and
      find out from neighbors if anyone else lives there since he could have
      hostages. The teams face is covered, they are inside perimeter, they can
      use gas on him if necessary. If he has a long rifle he can get them. They
      have to stay back and use high risk entry tactics. The team has to survey
      the house, will be close enough where he could hit them with a rock.
      (Negotiation Team Command Post) Neighbors stated he suffered a head trauma
      injury in WWII, but has never been to the hospital for mental illness, he
      has very poor eyesight, cataracts, heavy smoker, emphysema, bronchitis,
      hasn’t drank for 13 years, but if he’s drinking again he’ll be very
      hostile and, negative. He just was in detox 2 weeks ago – a good sign he’s
      been drinking again. His personal info is on the board “DOB 8/20/27 or
      29, divorced, ex-wife Mildred (lives with Gail) alcoholic who gets hostile
      when he drinks, has 4 children.” One cop knows him, didn’t know he was
      a problem. Sgt. Charles Resch says he’s a loner, has 3 or 4 old cars,
      his mom died 8 years ago, he’s kind of weird. The cop who was shot at
      says it went right between them, splinters of the door hit him. Officer
      Rick Stanek says he has a 300 rifle, 3-4 shotguns with ammo, a German
      Luger, 38 &amp; 45 revolver and a 25 automatic according to his son. Two
      weeks ago he called in for a report and they took him to detox instead of
      taking a report so he’s mad at the cops. They get a call of an attic.
      Cops back up with blast shield, they run behind a car, stay low. They hide
      behind a car, want to get close to shoot gas and others wait next door at
      4800. They want to negotiate, get him on the phone, if he won’t answer
      they’ll throw in a phone. Anything to talk him out, gas is the last
      chance, no turning back then. Sgt. Robert Gretton explains about the phone
      they are throwing in that will go back to the team directly to negotiate
      with them. The team goes up heavily armed with a shield, one smashes the
      window with a crowbar and the next tosses the phone in a bag. They call at
      4:44 PM that it is in. They beep it from the station and Larry calls for
      him to pick up. Outside they call in to pick up the phone. Larry wants to
      help, tells him open it up and pick it up. He picks up. He doesn’t blame
      him, they are both sick of listening to the beeper, what’s going on? He
      can hear him. Then he hangs up. (6:25 PM) He said he’s sick of the
      beeping and cut the line. Officer Dave Mattson is outside in camo gear.
      They want cold beers, fresh women and a pizza. Larry calls again. Sgt.
      John Hennessy says to be very authoritative, this is what they want him to
      do, no more playing around, for his own good. (8:08 PM) Larry tells him he
      has to talk to him. Ken says he had to tend to his dog’s foot and put
      peroxide on it. What’s all the yelling about? They want to talk to him.
      He says they like to hear themselves talk it’s so loud. Larry says it’s
      been an hour and half since he talked to him. People are going to react to
      him. What is it going to take to get him out? He wants Cordell and Ruben
      Johnson. He says Cordell is there. He says he’s not. That’s what they
      tell him, he can’t come on though. He won’t trust a cop, it’s like
      trusting Dillinger. Larry says if he puts Cordell on will he come out. He
      might. If he does something for Ken he has to so something for him. The
      team outside creeps around to get drinks and come back, knees are killing
      them and they are thirsty. They cut his power. He doesn’t give a crap,
      doesn’t need it. He needs him to come out, he has people lined up. Are
      you afraid of getting hurt? He’s seen those trigger happy sons of
      bitches in action. Larry says with all the people and the press around
      they aren’t going to get trigger happy. He has to help him though. He
      promises if he comes out he’ll secure the house and take the keys to his
      sister. He says he’ll consider coming out if he can bring his dog with
      him. He can’t do that. He’ll turn him over to his son Dustin though
      and leave him in the basement. Sgt. Robert Skmora listens. Larry says to
      put him down and come back. He says for tactical to get set up. It’s
      dark now. (9:39 PM) The plan is for him to come out. He wants to go to the
      VA. He was in 20 years ago for violence. He wants to see the SOB he talked
      to last time. Is he still there? He saw his name on the list. He wants to
      tell him how full of crap he is. If he tells him he’ll take him to the
      VA and they won’t accept him then what? That’s a different story, he
      doesn’t know, he won’t have any power then. They’ll talk to the
      people later. He wants them to talk now, later is crap. What else will it
      take to get him out? They worry about what they’ll do with him in the
      future. Dr. Steve Geiger, Psychological Consultant says they have to worry
      about that, can’t lie to him. He’ll say I listened to him once, he won’t
      again. He has access to lots of weaponry and will in the future. When he
      comes out they’ll place him under arrest and clear the house. Ken asks
      what does he want him to do. He wants him to walk out with his hands up,
      stand on the steps and listen to the officers for what to do. They call
      the tactical team that he is ready. He comes out in a dirty blue street
      and hat. They tell him to walk to them and turn around, down on his knees,
      keeps hands up, then lay on his stomach. Two guys go over and cuff him.
      They are worried about other people inside, but he says there is no one.
      They take him to the car. He says again he’s alone. Officer Riley
      Gilchrist comes over to Larry and shakes his hand and hugs him, good work.
      Ken got pissed that they were yelling at him outside and he came to the
      phone. Inside they show the two bullet holes in the door. There is a 30-30
      on the couch. He had a gas mask next to him, he was prepared. He has a
      semi automatic, lots of riles and ammo there. It would’ve been a hell of
      a battle. The place is a mess and there are pill bottles all over the
      tables. Chief John Laux arrives and tells them it’s recorded for
      posterity and will show they take a backseat to nobody, they are the best
      they proved it again tonight, nice job. The suspect was charges with
      second degree assault and released on bail the following day. #301.

    <td width="811" height="1"><b>Minneapolis, MN 2 - Rookies</b>   (Police
      Academy Survival Training Exercise) Cadet Mike Looney says to get out of
      the car with his hands in the air. He wanted to be a cop since he was a
      kid, maybe he's naïve ,but the fact you can help people is a noble
      position to be in. Officer Wes Edstrom supervises as he gets out of the
      car at gunpoint, cuffs and searches a guy. Mike is told to keep the back
      door open while searching them and put their feet back and head on the
      trunk to keep them off balance. When you go down to search don't go on
      your knees or they can kick you. It's looks good. (Practical Exercises
      Lab) Sgt. Dave Martenz draws on a board about the training, they can film
      them from all angles. They can see if they have it or not, how they treat
      people, if they have a bad attitude. He's not looking to scare them or
      drum them out, he wants it to be a positive experience. They are going to
      a bar scenario. The actors are real cops using lines they've all heard in
      the bars. Dave says he's heard it over 12 years while he watching, it's
      real interesting. The bartender says he's having trouble with drunk
      customers and wants them out. They try to talk to them and say why do they
      have to leave. It's their bar, they want them out. One woman fights and
      they throw them out. Then they find a gun on one guy and he claims he has
      a permit and wants to show it. He tries to get him to put the gun down as
      his partner holds him at gunpoint. They hold him back and he fights
      because he doesn't like to be restrained. He says he can walk out on his
      own. They say OK and the guy runs out. He comes back in with a gun and
      says for the cops to let her go or they'll get shot. They both run out.
      That's two in a row they screwed up. Dave says if they can't win don't go
      forward. (Cadet Graduation) They have to swear in and are official housing
      patrol cops in a large ceremony. Mike kisses his gum-chewing wife. (Roll
      Call) Sgt. Thomas Kerns reads out the assignment. 510 is Laplant and
      Zurwas, 520 is Hirsch and Looney. Mike was top man in his class and got
      the William Perry award – they are goofing on him. Talk to the Sgt about
      it. (8:40 PM) Officer Mike Looney says it's his first day. (911 Call
      Street Shooting) A black man in blue jeans, a blue hat with A on it and a
      black t-shirt is the shooter. Greg is driving him on his first day. Tom
      says she's all yours. They drive around looking for the guy and finally
      spot him. Mike holds him at gunpoint, Greg searches him and says he's
      sweating like a racehorse. The suspect asks what that means. He's cuffed
      and says he matches the description of a shooter. Where was he? He was at
      his girlfriend’s, cousin’s house. He turned away because he's scared
      out the police, not going to lie. His cousin lives right there at 206.
      They go back to the cordoned off scene to ID him. Officer Greg Hirsch says
      the hat is a Wrigley field diamond which looks like an A (9:10 PM) The
      ambulance is working on the victim with two gun shots in him. A witness
      with long dreadlocks says he saw him when he was sitting in front of his
      house and ID's him. It was a shooting at a crack house. The suspect was
      chasing the victim in his car, he hit an innocent car, crashed into a tree
      and the guy jumped out and shot him three times. He has a bunch of rock on
      him, might be a drug deal gone bad. The shooter gives him three different
      stories – he was watching TV with his girlfriend, then can't remember
      the show, then wasn't watching TV. (10:31 PM) The suspect is brought in.
      Mike says for the first day it feels good, after the years of college and
      school, now it starts to pay off. On the first day you want to catch all
      the bad guys. (4:35 PM Assistance Call) He says all rookies get in a mind
      set like they are going to change the world. One cop told him you aren't
      going to change the world, just go out and make your little dent. After 20
      years there will be someone behind you to do the same thing. A call of a
      confused elderly lady at a downtown store comes in. The woman says she
      missed the bus and was short on taxi fare. She's a government worker, on
      SSI and gets a check every third work. She's well known and called the
      police for a ride because she was always told to call a cop when she was
      in trouble. So they give her a ride. (5:20 PM) She says she works and is a
      good woman who earns a living. (9:21 PM 911 Call Assault in Progress) They
      spot a Mike, black guy in a yellow hat with his shirt falling off and put
      him in the car. The victim has a thick Russian accident. He says the guy
      attacked his friend, came up to him, was on drugs and took his watch. His
      friend comes up with a shirt wrapped around his head, his face is bruised,
      bloody and he needs stitches. He hit him with his fists and they ran to
      the gas station and found a pipe to defend themselves. Mike says those two
      guys attacked him and ripped his jacket, he doesn't know why and he hasn't
      been drinking. Officer Larry Krebsbach puts him in the ambulance. Officer
      Laurie Janikowski finds a watch in Mike's pocket and asks the victim to
      describe it. He says it's a cheap gold Rolex and it's broken, because he
      broke it. It's a match. (10:08 PM) Out there you are dealing with average
      people, good and bad. Arresting a felon, helping an old lady back home,
      it's part of the job. #302. 9/22/90</td>

    <td width="811" height="1"><b>Minneapolis, MN 3 - Women Cops</b>   (8:13 PM
      Domestic Disturbance) Third Precinct - Officer Janee Harteau says the main
      reason she became a cop because it was challenging, not a controlled
      environment, you deal with all kinds of people from all races and all
      levels of poverty from rich to poor. It's different, but everyone's the
      same. It's easier to talk to people when you are a female. They were
      brought up to talk first, physical next. Officer Holly Keegal has a blonde
      short puffy mullet and says originally was going to be a teacher, but took
      some law courses and really enjoyed it. She took more classes and decided
      to pursue law. They go into a backyard and there is a dirty white guy with
      a heavily stained shirt sitting there. He says he lives there, looks drunk
      and has trouble standing up They lead him around front to search him, find
      nothing, put him in the car and he flips out. He curses at them and says
      he didn't break any law and won't fully get in. The woman in the house
      says he's her brother. He's an alcoholic, one of the nicest guys when
      sober, but when drinking you stay away from him. They go back to him and
      he says &quot;take it easy, I don't care who you are, what are you trying
      to do, why don't you stop?&quot; They want him out so they can cuff him.
      He struggles, goes down, his shirt comes up and he tries to roll away when
      they go to cuff him. Holly puts her knee on his head. He curses them and
      says something about them failing training. Janee says it doesn't matter
      that they are women, they aren't messing around. They aren't getting away
      with it. On their off time we see Janee playing the drums with black
      gloves while Holly plays the keyboards in the garage. Holly took piano
      lessons for a little while, but gave it up to play sports. She can't read
      music, but plays by ear. She wears short pink shorts and a Guess top.
      Janee sings, she was in a band, so they got together and thinks they can
      really do good some day if they pursue it. It's a great stress reliever
      away from the job. (10:03 PM Theft in Progress) A young black kid was seen
      running. They pull up and Holly runs out and catches him. She stands on
      him and cuffs him. He was on a motorcycle and she brings him to the backup
      unit and puts him in the car. She goes back to the Vespa scooter. Sgt. Tom
      O'Rourke arrives as their car is making all kinds of noise. Holly explains
      the screw is off on the air conditioner. There were four of them, but they
      only caught him. He's a juvenile and will be booked for theft. A full jail
      is a happy jail. (3:21 AM) 911 Call Residential Robbery - Officer Pam
      Elius says it's quite a job, not anyone can do it, no other job is like
      it. She couldn't do anything else and wouldn't want to do anything else.
      Where else could you work 8 hours a day and have fun? A black man fled a
      house he robbed with a gun. They go to the house and the victim is an old
      woman who is terrified. She was sleeping and the guy came into her room
      and covered her mouth, she's worried her mouth is swollen. Officer Charles
      Teneyck writes her story down. Pam gets her water. Her mouth is fat and
      she tastes blood. He went through her purse, took her keys, told her he
      needs money because his kids were hungry. She went to get her purse and
      wouldn't turn the light on, but was afraid he would attack her. He came in
      the back window, but she only had $1 in there. She didn't hear him, he
      left out the back door and gave her the keys back. Pam checks the window
      and the screen is cut. She hopes with the info she gave them and the
      jewelry he stole they can track down the piece of scum. (4:47 AM Vehicle
      Fire) They go to a yellow van that is burning up as fire and black smoke
      are pouring out of it. They find a guy nearby and check him out. She moves
      the car away in case it blows up. She gets out to talk about blocking
      traffic and there is an explosion. The Fire Department arrives. Pam hopes
      there was no one inside, she called but got no answer. The guy says he and
      his girlfriend live in the van and are homeless, she lit a cigarette and
      he couldn't get her out. They don't find a body though. The guy has
      Tylenol 3 that he says it's for his leg. He talks slow and he’s out of
      it. He has chest pains. There’s no label on it the pills because he
      wanted to sell them. Pam says there was no girl there, but he says she
      was. He wants his pills back, she says to talk to the doctor. He wants to
      take a leak, she says only if he wants to go to jail. #303. 9/29/90</td>

      (5:26 PM Sexual Assault Call) Third Precinct - A call comes in from a
      woman who says her 11 year-old daughter has been raped, it just happened
      and the suspect has left the scene. Officer Dan McShane and Officer Paul
      Cottingham go up to the house and say her they don’t know where it
      happened, have no suspect info and will take it as they get it. They walk
      up to the dirty house and the TV is blaring. Macy the girl says cousin
      Randy was going to take her to McDonald's and Freddy would pay for it.
      Freddy told her they would go around the corner, he’s someone they know
      and trust, a friend of her aunt and he's 35-40. He told them to get in the
      car so she got in the back and he told her to come up front. They went to
      McDonald's ordered food and he didn't pay for it. He told her to come in
      his car and sit up there, she said no, she was going to go to McDonald's
      and he said no, but they went anyway. He wanted to go to the movies, she
      said they couldn’t do that and he started the car, she wanted to go
      home, he parked and asked her to show him something. She says she didn't
      have anything. Then he said he would show her something. She said no. Did
      she know what he was talking about? Yeah, his private parts. He started
      driving, almost crashed and she yelled. He put his hand on her leg and she
      started crying. He said you are scared huh? Macy and her mom then cry. It
      will be molestation and they will turn over to child welfare. They will
      get back to her, they take it very serious. Avoid contact with Freddy,
      they'll get back to them, it could be something he does often. She did the
      right thing by telling her mom, she was very brave, a lot of people don’t
      tell, otherwise it could go on. Stay away from him, it's a bad scene.
      (Roll Call) Fifth Precinct - Officer Don Bautista says they had an unusual
      burglary last night, all he did was go through the woman's underwear,
      sexual in nature. She is a counselor from St. Mary's chemical
      dependencies. He was discharged on Monday, has called and left her a
      message on her machine. He works at a Pizzeria, is a 20 year old white
      male, they'll talk to him tonight and see what his story is. All he did
      was take her underwear out and did what those type of people do. (7:45 PM
      Burglary Investigation) They go to Ribizza looking for Ben, he isn't
      there, but will be back in 15 minutes. He’s wearing a white t-shirt and
      dark shorts. They get him when he pulls up and detain him. He's curious as
      to what is going on. There was a burglary on 27th &amp; Xerxes last night
      while he was working to someone he's familiar with. He says Tracy is the
      only one she knows living there. He has surprised her when she was
      sunbathing at home and on the beach. He says he said hello to her at the
      beach and she was expecting him at the house. He's been in her house
      before with her, with her permission. It's just an interview, so he's let
      go. He goes to see Tracy. She says she didn't call Ben and didn't make a
      date with him. He tells her what Ben said that she made advances towards
      him. He knows this is false. There is no relationship between them. She
      says &quot;oh, god&quot; about her dating him, he must have quite a
      record. He says he has no record and checked around the world. She asks if
      he thinks Ben will do something. He can't guarantee that. When she comes
      home, open the door, don't go in, wait, listen. Don't go anywhere alone,
      bring people with you. The guy is a wacko, you've read the papers. They
      have probable cause to arrest him and goes back to Ribizza to look for
      him. He goes in and finds him in the back. He is searched, cuffed, taken
      downtown and mirandized. (7:17 PM Domestic Violence Call) Third Precinct -
      Officer John Billington says it seems whenever you get alcohol and drugs
      in the picture it gets worse. Lots more domestics lately, whenever force
      is used on people living together they have to make an arrest. Officer
      Steve Setzer is his partner. They get a call from a woman saying her
      husband is smoking crack in the house and she wants him out. They pull up,
      she says he's in the bathroom freaking out and has kids inside and a gun.
      They don't want to go in and say she should get an order of protection
      against him. They go in eventually slowly with guns drawn and head
      upstairs. They find Quinn up there, but he goes down the hall on him. He
      says he didn't put his hands on nobody, hasn't done anything. They go to
      cuff him and he says don't take me please. They are just talking to him.
      There are two infants laying on the bed. He says when he got back they
      really started arguing. He's breathing heavy, says he's hot, really scared
      and not on crack. John changes a diaper on a crying baby. The woman says
      he spent the whole rent check on crack, he was swinging things around, she
      was really scared and he was foaming at the mouth. They tried to keep him
      inside until the ambulance came, but he was slinging them around. Quinn is
      sweating bullets, says he didn't mean nobody harm, didn't hurt anyone. She
      says he needs help. She went to Chicago with her mom, came back and he
      sold everything. All of her furniture was gone, he sold it. They can't
      find any drugs, so will take him for domestic. He promises not to do
      anything and will leave. He says she can get a restraining order on him,
      just don't arrest him. They tell her to go to the county, floor 17 and
      file a OOP on him. He just wanted to take his car and leave. She says he
      went out to get pot, he came back, went into the bathroom and she smelled
      smoke. He came out, threw her and his sister around. It appeared like he
      was smoking crack. The sad part was he checked the diapers not to see if
      they were wet, but to see if he shoved the crack in there, he's seen it
      before. A cop can't expect he can change the world, but he can make it a
      little better. #304. 10/6/90</td>

      Briefing) Deputy Chief Doug Smith says the Skinheads, Lawyers Guild and
      Woman against Military Madness will be in the demonstration at 3:30 PM by
      the federal building. Expect 300-500 people. They don't have a parade
      permit, won't disclose it so they’ll go in private to discourage and
      provoke the police. They will provoke by spray painting things. If cops
      move in they will throw rocks at them. They will ID the leaders and may
      wait until the end before they arrest people. A female cop goes undercover
      as a punk goth chick in a black wig with black lipstick. The cops get all
      their riot gear ready. A speaker says they have no permit, but will march
      anyway. A hippy leader approaches police who will assist them in any way
      possible. They will give a police escort, but keep the traffic blockage to
      a minimum and no vandalism. The guy says they don't want any trouble, want
      to march, traffic support is OK. Their chant is &quot;We're going to beat
      back the Bush attack&quot; and &quot;1234 we don't want their bloody
      war.&quot; They put up posters and burn a dummy. Then things get out of
      hand and one person is arrested. They tell the leader they have painted
      the building twice, vandalized, enough is enough, time to move along. A
      couple fights and are arrested. The goal was to wait and surgically remove
      the leaders. A guy threw paint bombs and two people jumped them, all are
      arrested. (5:05 PM Debriefing) The leader bit an IDS guard and went to

      guy has a huge stick in his pocket. He says a guy broke out his car window
      and called them niggers. Officer John Billington goes to the victim. He's
      a white guy with a bunch of cuts and a bloody nose he covers. He says they
      ran through his yard, didn't see them, but knows their car. Three black
      guys tried to break into his garage, he confronted them, they beat him and
      took off. His car also has windows broken out. One of the crooks says he
      punched him in the face and pulled a knife on them and they took off. He
      says there were two of them and stabbed their windows. One guy keeps
      yelling and John tells them to speak English, he's listening, stop the
      garbage. The guy in a Batman shirt gets loud and says the guy accused him
      of going through his yard. They ran and thought they caught him. The
      victim says they came through his yard and they beat him up. The criminals
      says they left their house, went to their car, the guy yelled at them,
      smashed their car and they chased him, but didn't catch them. No one knows
      what happened, both are lying and they can't tell who is telling the
      truth. They are going to write them up and cut them loose. What about
      their car? That's what insurance is for. Fourth Precinct Roll Call - Sgt.

      and steals things, tools and more. Officer Bill Thornberg has been there

      shovel. There is a massive group of people there when they arrive. The
      victim is on a lawn and is bloody and squirming. A woman and her children
      are screaming and crying all around. Bill says to move back, give him air,
      it's hot as hell. The victim's ear is split and he needs to stay down, but
      keeps trying to move. A crowd stands around, they don't know who he is,
      but know the guy who did it though. His name is Terry and the victim is
      George. He’s bleeding from his arm and ear. EMS arrives, says he's
      unconscious, they need to move him fast and holds his head. It's a
      struggle to move him. A witness says Terry broke a beer bottle and hit
      him. He pulled out a bunch of his hair, then they started punching and
      fighting. He was stabbed 4-5 times with bottle, split ear, cut artery in
      neck, spurting blood. It wasn't a shovel. They caught Terry a few blocks
      away. George's mother holds a bloody rag and throws it at the suspect. She

      They take his stuff and damage his property. He found a kid on his roof,
      didn't know who was up there and they wouldn't come down so he told them
      if they didn't come down he said he would go get his gun. He admits it was
      the heat of the moment, a dumb thing to say, but he was tired because he
      had a really bad day and took it out on the kids. Greg says she can follow
      a criminal complaint on him and goes back and has the guy apologize so it

      next time ask the guy before you climb on his garage. (911 Call Domestic
      Violence) Officer Bill Thornberg says with domestics you never know what
      to expect when you get there. The tradition is a man threatening or
      hitting a woman and he goes off to jail, but you never know. Andrea Jones
      calls that her boyfriend went off on her, he's on cocaine, she can't
      control him and she cries. It is nighttime at house 1530. They walk up and
      hear gunfire in the distance. The guy inside says he's drunk again. She
      says he threatened to kill her and 911 heard it. He says it's just a
      threat thing, he does it all the time, but she denies it. He just came
      home, accused her of crazy things and threw her down. Police have been
      there before and she never pressed charges because she loved him. She
      wants him out, wants him arrested and wants to press charges. All her
      family is dead except for her sister upstairs and she couldn't get a hold
      of her. She said she didn't do anything. Officer Chuck Nathan checks him
      for weapons. She says he's been on coke for months and called her a slut.
      She was at her sisters, not at bars, found out he was on coke two weeks
      ago and called the crisis line, but they don't understand. Bill says no,
      he hasn't been out there before and gives her a card with victims rights
      and domestic violence info, how to get a restraining order and the number
      for a battered women's shelter. She says it's her home and if she leaves
      he'll follow her. They tell her to leave the phone off the hook. She
      doesn't want them to let him out tonight. Bill says they'll call before
      they let him out. She says to ask his mom how abusive he is, but only to
      her. Third Precinct - Officer Steve Setzer says the call is for neighbor
      trouble, one threatening another. It's pitch black when they walk up to
      the house and a guy says they are in the back fighting. They walk around
      and can hear a woman yelling. She said she heard the woman neighbor
      saying, &quot;I hate those niggers and niggers this.&quot; The second
      woman says they cut her power and has to have all the smoke detectors
      wired together. She's white and was in her house having a private
      conversation. The black lady says she could hear it in her kitchen.
      Officer Cheri Dexter talks to her, she says she has two witnesses. Cheri
      says there is nothing they can do, how are they going to get along, it's
      between them and the landlord. A black guy with no shirt appears and says
      they threw beer at them. She says they threatened to blow up her house.
      Steve says for them all to go to bed and ignore each other. She says she
      pays $48 a month and it's a nice place. The white guy is drunk and told
      the black guy, &quot;…for the niggers to get out of here.&quot; They go

      Magistrate Abner Golorgergen meets them at the tiny airport. They ride in
      a truck to the magistrate’s office. Once there they talk to an Eskimo
      who seems high and usually isn't like that. There is a makeshift court in

      public building and was drunk in the second judicial district. The highest
      penalty is $5,000 and a year in jail. Ike says the man is a danger by the
      state of his mind and asks that bail be set in the matter. It is set at
      $1000. Abner wears sunglasses and jeans and as soon as he's done he takes
      the robe off. They have to take the man's possessions, but he doesn't want
      them to. He wants to take them home. He says they have to do it and he is

      city stuck in a vast wilderness. They've had five hit &amp; runs in the

      parking lot with a brown car under the back end. The guy ran off and
      witnesses point him across the street. The guy is behind a building where
      a woman is keeping her eye on him. He searches him and asks if he had any
      beers. He says three. Mark asks him if he had them all at the same time
      and he says yes. He admits he only backed over one car because he didn't
      see it. He didn't hit anyone else. His DOB is 2/31/59. Mark talks to

      go ahead and arrest him. They agree. They take him back to the station and
      his BAC is .232. He says the Fiat parked behind him, it wasn't his fault.
      He skimmed off a car at a bar. Which one? The bar where they found him. He
      wasn't at a bar, he was at a credit union. He was? Mark says maybe they
      serve drinks there. The magistrate can't believe the damage he caused and
      since the guy only has $50 on him he won't make bail which is good because
      he's so dangerous. He can't believe no one got killed in his rampage.

      ID it by whatever means, then notify the next of kin and get the remains
      back to them. A Cessna 207 during an hour flight tour that took people
      from a cruise ship hit the side of a mountain. They are supposed to meet
      climbers there. They land the helicopter on a mountain and walk over. Two

      about being a trooper is the gratification from getting the job done. The
      only good thing there will be is to bring the remains back to the family.
      They find the body, load it up in a bag, move the helicopter and lower a
      tow rope down to get it. The father of the dead girl was waiting for her,
      but had to go back to Florida for medical reasons. Back at the base Jerry

      he wanted it. EMS needs to take him to the hospital, the kid says he had a
      couple of Coronas. He lives on Jewel Lake and has no phone. A witness says
      he saw the kid crawling away and the Brian picked him up and threw him,
      then tried to carry him away. He grabbed him and made him put the kid

      drink. Brian says he wanted it. He drank some and didn't want anymore and
      they said to take it. Marc goes in to talk to the parents. Mom wants to
      kill Brian and Marc says he might himself. They do have a phone and call
      Providence Hospital. In the hospital the kid screams like crazy when they
      put a line in his throat with an IV in. His BAC is .178, would be 7-8
      drinks for an adult, less for the kid. They won't charge Brian until they
      know more. They give him a citation instead of going to jail, but he'll
      have to go to court. The kid seems like a zombie. Marc says the kid
      could've died and Brian is stupid. Anytime a kid is in danger it hits

      it. He put it in his bag while he was still shopping. Scott tells him it's
      concealment. He tells him to sit and he starts crying. The dad says he's
      never done it before and had enough cash to buy it. There is a TMNT poster
      on the back door where he's sitting. There is an Archie Comics rack with

      concealment and removal, he has to explain to his dad the difference, but
      both are a crime. The kid has a swatch watch with a swatch guard too.

      Young and Officer Thomas Monihan (911 Call - Rape)
      Southeast Area Command – Tom calls in that a woman was raped and the
      operator asks when it happened. A few minutes ago, the girl is at his
      apartment, does she need an ambulance? No, he’s putting ice packs on her
      head, she’s hysterical. Keep her there. Officer Jack Clark goes to the
      house and Tom answers. He talks to Kelly, she has her head in lap crying
      and mumbling. Where did it happen, here? No. She knows the guy, he’s in
      his 40s, 50s. She was trying to sleep and this guy came over and tried to
      stick his fingers in her. Tom’s seen him by the Jacuzzi, talked to him,
      doesn’t really know him. They go around the corner, upstairs to the
      apartment where the guy lives. There are two guys sitting at the kitchen
      table under a huge American flag. There’s a shirtless bearded man
      climbing out the window and Jack pulls his gun and says give me a reason.
      He comes back in and Jack asks him if he’s Phil. He says no, he’s
      sleeping. They pull back the covers and Phil is in bed in his underwear.
      He doesn’t want to get up, wants to know what’s wrong so Jack jumps
      him and puts his knee on his back and cuffs him. He pulls him up and the
      man says easy. Officer Peter Rubini talks to John Christian. They don’t
      know what’s going on. He says Kelly was raped. She’s been there for
      two days and was passed out in the bed stark naked. The old guy went in
      there and laid down, they had a party, but he didn’t rape her. He didn’t
      do anything wrong, then she got up screaming. They take him out and say
      the problem is when they go to the jury it becomes a moral question
      instead of a legal question. Did he force himself on her? The evidence
      shows him that he did. Laughlin, NV (5:4 PM Child Neglect Complaint)
      Substation – Officer John Sias goes out to his truck and says it is a

      there, now there are 4500. On New Year’s Eve they had 70,000 people
      there. Their problem is having a lot of transients. It’s known as a
      boomtown so it draws a lot of people. He’s going to check on kids living
      in a trailer in unsanitary conditions. He goes into a casino and asks for
      Jimbo or Jenny. They aren’t sure if they are working. The kids are
      living in a trailer in the parking lot. The manager tried to look inside,
      but there’s a big dog tied to it. He drives them to the lot and there’s
      tons of trailers. He talks to the guy inside about the complaint and asks
      if there’s anyone else there, he’s not the father. John looks around,
      says it’s not safe and is unsanitary. He has to take them to Child
      Haven. He tells the girl he’s taking her there, it’s a nice place with
      toys, she’ll have to stay two days and be out Monday. Do you have a
      special toy you want to bring? Yes, what about your brother Cordell? Can
      you explain it to him? You are being a big girl, I need your help. He
      thanks the guy and he says to go before he’s not so cooperative. John
      says he better remain that way. The manager says he wants them out of
      there by tomorrow. They find out Bobbie, the mother, works in the casino
      as a dealer and they go to talk to her. She says she’s fine. John
      explains what happened and all she says is really, someone complained? He
      says it’s a mess, no fridge, no food, the bathroom stank and didn’t
      work plus the children weren’t clean. She says they hadn’t had a bath
      today. He’s taking the kids, they’ll be in the kids care, not the
      detention side. Something has to be done. She’ll send them to her mom’s
      house in California. She isn’t concerned at all. He understands she’s
      working on it, but he can’t leave them there. Las Vegas (6:33 PM Strong
      Arm Robbery) Northeast Area Command – Officer Joseph Lombardo says
      downtown has a variety of everything from street pushers, whores,
      transients, homeless and vagrants. You see them on TV and feel sorry for
      them, but an old guy is taking purses from old ladies, knocking them down,
      hurting them. He gives chase after a man was yelling for help. He catches
      the guy for robbing a blind man. They know Mike, they’ve arrested him
      before. Mike says you love me then. He checks him and says to go get the
      guy with the cane on the corner. He’s lying because he must be running
      for some reason. He cuffs him and he can barely get up. They bring the old
      man he robbed who says he took a whole lot of money from him, $6 or $7.
      Officer Thomas Fletcher gives him the money back and asks what happened.
      He was walking on Freemont Street and Mike reached in his pocket and took
      his money. He has polio, couldn’t chase him, told him to stop and is
      always in fear of his life. He’ll go to jail as long as he agrees to
      testify. It’s a worse crime, a larceny if he’s in fear. Mike
      specializes in victims, he watches and waits for them, preys on them. They
      take him to jail, before it was just petty and loitering, now it’s a
      felony, he’ll spend time in jail. (11:01 PM Communication Center) a
      woman takes a 911 call about a runaway car traveling in circles in the
      Mirage parking lot. They don’t know where the driver is. They pull up
      and someone suggests shooting out the tires. Cops say no. It’s an old
      blue car with a white hard top. People want to jump in, but they say to
      stay back. They ask for a large semi truck to block it. They talk to the
      woman owner who agrees they can break the window. Officer Dennis Magill runs over,
      whacks it with the nightstick on the passenger side and jumps in and stops
      it. The crowd cheers and he gives high fives. They say it was a wise
      decision, $50 to replace the window instead of smashing it with the
      trailer. They are all happy about it and he goes back and helps clean the
      glass out. He asks her how did it happen? It slipped out of park, she didn’t
      have it all the way in, got out and left it running, it hit the trailer
      and went around in circles. He doesn’t know how it happened, but nobody
      got hurt.

      Court #4) Metro PD Judge Earle W. White, Jr. meets with Officer Randy
      Sutton in his chambers. He says the warrant is for a seizure of a bunch of
      guns. It started as a burglary of guns and drugs - legal steroids from
      Jeff. He found the guy who robbed him and took Randy to the suspect’s
      house in Henderson where he had the stuff. He told him the story how he
      was put on his knees at gunpoint and interrogated. He asked him how he
      came to Jeff’s house. He bought steroids from him for four months, he’s
      a big guy, body builder. Randy went to Judge Levitt and got papers. He’s
      a big gun aficionado. He came to the door with a glock on his hip when
      they arrested him. He has AK-47, he went to jail, is out now, but they
      want to go back and get the rest of the guns. Earle makes him swear that
      what he says is true and he does and signs it. Randy says outside they
      aren’t arresting him, they are just taking the guns, but they need
      warrants to remove the guns. Whenever you go to seize guns there is a
      heightened sense of danger. (4:00 PM Execution of Search Warrant) Randy
      knocks and tells Jeff to come out. A guy is standing and Randy tells him
      to get down at gunpoint because he has a gun on him and takes it. He asks
      if Jeff about the guns and he goes to get the key for the case and he
      tells him to sit. He says they can take all his guns and he’s not happy
      about it so they give him the warrant. They make him move away from the
      guns and unload the gun from the guest. They go in the closest and pull
      out assault rifles. The other guy had a pistol in a holster on his hip
      when they came in, so it’s not CCW. They find a huge box of steroids so
      Jeff’s under arrest again. He says they are the same ones from before.
      Under the bed are more guns and they start putting them on the bed and
      soon the bed is covered. Officer Chuck Pierce Jr. finds Jeff’s drug
      sales book and there are lots of high dollar sales listed including one
      for $1,500. Randy by law has to make a list of all the things he’s
      taking and knows he’s going to be there awhile and starts with an Uzi.
      Chuck makes call to Jeff’s relatives that they are arresting him and
      taking three semis, handguns, 100 pounds of ammo and 40-50 clips. Randy
      reads the label on the steroids that says “for vets to administer to
      horses only” and doesn’t think he would take something meant for
      horses. (10:20 PM Suspicious Person) Northeast Area Command – Officer

      Corps, became a military policeman, got out and has was hired in Vegas. He
      goes to a hotel at the 2000 block of Freemont and tells Jerry who is drunk
      to come out of the bushes. He talks to Peggy who was hiding from him and
      has kids, says they aren’t alone because she’s paying for a
      babysitter. How does she afford it? Her boyfriend is in prison. She’s
      been in Vegas for five days, she flushed her license, will show something
      else for ID. The drunk guy says she was paying $188 a week for a hotel and
      he was trying to find a cheaper place. She has Colorado ID, is going to
      dealer school and college? Which is it? She says they are the same. The
      guy says he sold his ID in 1987. They ask him why he did that. A guy
      needed it. The girl cries, says she has a 19 month old kid, she knows the
      guy’s a punk and a trouble maker, but she just moved here. The cops know
      the drunk guy. The cops admit they don’t know him and tell her to relax,
      she says she’s not spazzing. She met him at the Ambassador while playing
      some nickels slots and told him her story. Her mom died two weeks ago, she’s
      from Clinton, IO and thought this place was like Reno. What’s Reno like?
      Nicer. Tom is worried she’s out drinking beer in the bushes while her
      kids are alone. She says they aren’t and she has a 5 year old and a 2
      year old. They remember seeing Jerry drinking behind the mini mart a few
      weeks ago. He admits he was there drinking. They tell him to go. He goes
      to get her bag and she tells him not to. They tell Peggy she can go and
      not to jump in the bushes with some scrounge she doesn’t know. She says
      where she’s from they believe people. She doesn’t know anybody here
      and she holds stuffed animals. They say she knows them know. Give them a
      call if she needs anything from now on. They see a lot of people like
      that, they come with their boyfriends and they leave them after a week and

      himself comfortable and she’ll go in the bathroom. Mike and Leon bust
      him. The guy says 'oh, no. It's embarrassing.&quot; They tell him it's
      worse to get AIDS. There are now 72 whores that have AIDS on the street.

      Jessie, an eight year-old boy, who ran away an hour ago after a domestic
      dispute and hasn't been seen since. He pulls up to #2645, clipboard in
      hand. The woman says he was beating up on some kids and she got done
      talking to him and sent him to his room until dinner and he might not get
      any. She never does that. Then her younger son Ricky told her he ran out
      the door with his backpack filled with toys. She went to the school, drove
      around to look for him, but didn’t find him. Randy calls Gloria on the
      phone then there is a knock on the door. The neighbors found Jessie and
      returned him. Randy calls the kid over and asks why he did it. He says
      Dave and cries. He says Dave hits him and all that, he’s his baby
      brother’s dad. He hits them both. Ricky says he doesn’t hit him. Jess
      says he does. He kicks him in the head in the morning to get him to go to
      school. He shows a mark on his face from him. He ran away because of Dave
      and thought his mom would be better off without him. Randy says that’s
      not true and he’ll talk to them both if he promises not to run away
      again. She’s holding a baby and says Dave never hit him with a belt, but
      he’s threatened to use it. He’s never been punched or slapped, but
      doesn’t know how he got the mark on his face. He doesn’t like Dave
      because he’s strict with him, he’s the only one who can keep him in
      line. She told him Dave would take care of him when he got home, that
      might be why he ran away. Randy sees no signs of abuse and lets him stay
      there. He leaves and thinks there is a grain of truth to the story, so he’s
      filing a report on it. (10:30 PM Traffic Stop) Southeast Area Command –
      Officer Dominick Rodriguez says if he can help someone out he’ll do it.
      That’s the best thing when you see someone in a tight spot who needs
      help and you can come through for them it’s a good feeling. He spots a
      small car run through a red light, it’s one of his pet peeves because it
      causes a lot of accidents. Carrie is laughing when he walks up. She says
      it wasn’t red when she went through and doesn’t have her license
      because she left it at home. She doesn’t drink, doesn’t do nothing. He
      writes her a ticket. She’s never run a red light before. He has her sign
      the ticket. She says deep inside she fells like he thinks she’s really
      guilty. He says he’s doesn’t, don’t be too upset about it, just don’t
      do it again. She says she’s shy and goes to start the car and it won’t
      start. She says it’s a bad alternator. She says it’s a 4 speed and she’s
      not good at push starting it. He says she has a complex. He’ll push her,
      pop it into second when she gets to the sign and it’ll be ready to go.
      He pushes her with the police car, then pulls up next to her and she says
      she ran out of gas. He says he’ll drive her to the gas station. She says
      it’s really embarrassing. He takes her to a phone and she calls the
      wrong he number. Then she calls her mom Carol and can’t handle it. Dom
      talks to her, says he needs to give Carrie a ride home. He explains she
      has a leak and doesn’t want to leave her at the 7-11, but he can’t
      drive her across town, she’ll be at Flamingo and Eastern. He feels safe
      leaving her there. Clark County Detention Center - Lt. Patricia Kessel
      says the first time coming to jail has got to be a horrendous experience,
      she would be terrified and she’s been there 12 years now. If you get
      someone shouting orders here and there, telling you do this, do that and
      you don’t know what’s happening to you, you are not a free person. It’s
      understandable that you are upset. They teach officers IPC – Inter
      Personal Communication. One of the most vital parts of their training
      program is to teach folks that when someone comes in and they are angry,
      calling you every obscene name in the book, clutching at you, grabbing at
      you or whatever, it’s not you they are angry at, it’s what you
      represent. They bring a drunk guy in and take his picture. He’s an older
      guy, says he’s got money and drives a Cadillac. They don’t want to
      hear he’s someone who knows the sheriff and everyone. Pat says they want
      a blood sample from him. They don’t want to grab them by the hair, it
      looks really bad, it’s a tactic that hurts, but doesn’t injure. It
      gets their attention, you have to get their attention before they’ll
      listen to you. The guy from before hit his face on the wall and bust his
      nose and mouth. He’s bleeding and a nurse cleans him up. Pat begs him to
      cooperate, they aren’t there to fight. He needs to agree to submit. He
      says he’s not fighting with anyone. She says he just needs to do what
      they ask. He says he’s not resisting and agrees to take a breath test,
      it’s that or blood. Officer Jack Clark talks to a woman who is
      belligerent. She curses him out and wants the cuffs off, but he won’t.
      She says someone needs to. She was caught giving oral sex in the back of a
      car and her fly is open. The guy from before says Jack hit him, someone
      hit him. He explains he hit the wall outside. Then he refuses the blood
      test so they take him off to the drunk tank. They smell alcohol on him.
      They’ll let him calm down and sleep it off. They take blood from another
      guy who asks why they are doing it. He says he wants them to test it for
      every kind of disease. The guy from before got all squirrelly in
      isolation. He got the cuffs off and punched a cop right in the face. They’ll
      have to file a report. They’ve heard, “I know the sheriff, the
      governor, I pay your salary.” She wants to ask them for a raise then.

      Doug Gillespie tells him 575 wants to know what's going on 44 and 420, ran
      out the back. Patrol went to a house to get someone on a homicide warrant
      and the guy took off out the back door. He's armed with a knife and wanted
      for battery with a deadly weapon. He says the guy hopped over the back
      wall. Mike goes around back with the dog into a garage and asks an owner
      if they can go into their backyard to search. He says it's the worst kind
      of search he can do, he's worried more about getting shot by a resident
      than a suspect. They think someone is trying to rob them and shoot out
      their window or let their dogs out. He doesn't find anything and hears
      cops calling because another K-9 unit found him. He's cuffed on the ground
      with the dog trying to get him. One dog almost gets him and they yell at
      him to walk past them. He walks like he has all the time in the world.
      Mike has to yell to get the dog to stop. The guy says he just pushed her
      away, he's told he has warrants for attempted assault and attempted sexual
      battery. Mike trades barbs with the other K-9 officer. He calls him a
      rookie and he found him first, Mike says his dog was calm enough to cuff
      him, Doug says he would be calm too since he didn't make the catch. Mike
      says it's beginners luck, he's still a rookie and can't lie, there is
      competition, he wanted to make the catch, but Eich thinks he did anyway,
      so he still thinks he's top dog. (4:00 PM Indecent Exposure Call) Officer
      Randy Sutton says there are 240 million people in the country and only
      500,000 cops. When you put on that uniform it's a lot of responsibility.
      The courts decided a cop can be sued as well as the department. What he
      worked so hard to get can be removed from him if the court decides he
      violated someone's rights. He goes to the call of Tanya who can see a man
      in his apartment with the drapes open masturbating in the window. The
      woman is outside when he pulls up and she points to where he is, but can't
      see him now. He backs up to get out of the way. She says he stands in the
      window with the curtains up and the window open and he plays with himself,
      it's embarrassing. She's getting sick of it and he acts like he hides.
      Tanya will file a crime report on him. Randy knocks on B1 and the guy says
      he's alone and he's wearing nothing but a small towel around his waist.
      Randy mirandizes him and asks if he knows why he's here. He says what is
      he supposed to say, he has a problem with her, but doesn't know her. He
      has scars on his back, knows what he was doing was wrong, is not going to
      deny it, but it was a spur of the moment thing. There was something about
      her, he saw her at the pool, liked the way she looked and thinks she's
      married. He's done it a couple times in front of her, but just her. He can
      see her across the way, finds her sexually attractive and there's not much
      he can really say. Randy tells him to get dressed. He has to go downtown
      and be charged with open and gross lewdness. If he's never been arrested
      they'll let him go. Is it necessary for him to be arrested. It's illegal
      to masturbate in front of women in Nevada. (12:15 AM Disturbance Call)
      Southeast Area Command - Officer Dominick Rodriguez says he always wanted
      to become a cop, was raised in this town and knows it sounds corny but he
      loves his community. He wanted to be a cop since he was a kid and wants to
      participate in helping the community instead of complaining about it.
      There are people in the emergency room raising heck and refusing to leave.
      A woman points to security and says two young guys are drunk and creating
      a disturbance. Mike cut off the tip of his finger and wanted to be seen
      first and got obnoxious. He asked him to leave, he wouldn't, they are
      packed and she wants him out. She will file a trespass on him. They guy is
      on the phone when Dom goes in. He tells him to get off. He says he's been
      there 90 minutes, he needs stitches and needs help now. He has a bloody
      towel on his hand and called 911 and they said they have to help him. Mike
      says the guard is playing Mr. Hero, won't help him, he's there first. Dom
      says it's a private hospital and they don't have to take care of him. Mike
      says his uncle is Chuck Thompson and he'll take care of them all. A guy
      and a girl come over and start yelling it's a customer service problem. He
      asks if someone had a gun in his stomach would they wait? The guy comes
      back and says he's been bleeding for two hours and Dom says he'll arrest
      Donald for obstruction. They feel strongly about him leaving, he'll go in
      and talk to them. He talks to a woman who says it's not an emergency and
      not life threatening. He needs 2 maybe 3 stitches and he's only been there
      30 minutes. The others are a priority, they take them in priority order,
      people came in by ambulance and he spread the wound apart to make it
      bleed. Mike says she told him it would be 5 stitches. The waiting process
      is part of the game. He denies he was there only 30 minutes. Dom
      sympathizes with them, but they have to play the game and wait, other
      people have problems too. #316. 1/12/91</td>

      Jersey City - Officer Thomas Porter chose the job because his brother was
      in the department and most people on the block were cops, so he figured he
      might as well join. He's driving toward the WTC and says there's excellent
      job security, the money's not bad, the benefits are great and someone has
      to do it, doesn't mind helping people out once in a while, that's the job.
      Officer Robert Falconetti is his partner and they go to the call of a man
      shot in his car on Second and New York Ave. He is put in the ambulance
      since he's hit in the head. The car is off to the side on the curb with
      bullet holes in the window and spent shells on the ground so they leave it
      to the investigators. A call comes in that someone saw the shooter so they
      drive over to his backyard and eight cops chase down the tall black guy
      who says he doesn't know what happened. He's the right guy, but they can't
      find the gun that fired the 10 shots. (2:30 AM Shooting Call) Another
      shooting happened down the road, another fun night in the city. Tony is a
      black guy sitting on some stairs with a wound to the neck. They ask who
      shot him, he doesn't know, they took his wallet. They tell the ambulance
      to hurry since he's falling over. Tom tells the guy to go and asks if he
      stutters. EMS arrives. It's common in the projects, close to the first of
      the month, today is the fourth, they've had enough time to get their
      checks and go crazy. They go out on foot and ask the people around if they
      saw anything, but no one says a thing. There are lots of violent crimes
      and no one wants to rat on their friends. It's the code of silence, if
      they rat on someone, they'll be next. Hoboken - Sgt. Mike Plunkett asks
      the officers if they have their helmets and hands out their night sticks.
      They are short handed with only four of them until 8 o’clock. Have a
      good night. His great-great grandfather was a cop there in 1876 and his
      family has lived there since. There’s not as many crimes as there used
      to be. Lots of the bars now cater to the yuppies, instead of the working
      class when he was a kid, lots more fights back then. (5:15 PM Disturbance
      Call) He’s going to Redheads bar where the owner has a bat on a
      customer. The guy says a man threatened him over the phone with a bat.
      Someone broke into his house in Jersey City and has a bat with his name on
      it. They talk to the owner who says the guy charged $1300 on his account
      for City Paint and Johnny is getting billed for it. The guy says he used
      him as a reference and they sent the bill here by mistake. He says he
      bought stuff for the lady and they mistakenly assumed it was for Redheads.
      They said to bill it to Redheads and he said fine. He's paying it right
      now. He says Johnny told him his house was robbed. The Sgt. says the guy
      knew they were charging him and he gets tired of the guy talking and
      interrupting him. He yells at him to stop and tells Johnny he can file a
      complaint with the detective, it's a lot of money. He can file right now
      if he's threatened. Johnny says he didn't say it. The guy keeps saying he
      can't watch his back and the Sgt. believes Johnny. The guy keeps saying
      it's against the law to make threats and the account has been settled so
      he can do what he want. It'll be settled in court, not here. After Mike
      says people come from all over the world to see the NYC skyline and they
      see it every day. The shot includes the WTC. Orange PD - Officer Dennis
      Vega says it's good to know the community you are in. He was born and
      raised there. Lots of the cops there were born and raised in Orange and
      are trying to give back to the town. He goes to a block party and shakes
      hands with people as do other cops. (3:15 PM Domestic Call) A man took his
      child from the mother so they go to her rundown apartment and talk to the
      mother. The door is bashed and smashed and has ‘Jones’ written on it
      in marker. He won't open the door so they call him on the phone and tell
      him to open the door. He puts the mom on the phone and she says she wants
      her baby, he tells her to screw off. Her friend has a shirt that reads 'If
      you don't like my attitude dial 1-800-eat-sh!t' right in front of her
      kids. Dennis gets back on the phone and says he wants to make sure the
      baby is OK and to clear the hall. He finally opens the door and is still
      on the phone. He surrenders the kid, shakes the guys hand and tells him he
      can't use their kid to solve their problems. It'll make him look bad, even
      if he's right. These kind of situations can be explosive. The job has lots
      of judgment calls. Over the credits the WTC is seen from a distance. #317.

      Officer Emergency) Metropolitan PD Southeast Area Command - Officer Jack
      Clark says because of the area with the high concentration of bars and
      casinos they have a DWI problem. People are either
      walking or driving, then it becomes a much more serious problem to put a
      thousand pound car in the hands of a drunk. He pulls over a white rental
      Cadillac with the horn stuck. They pop the hood and he tells them they can
      pull it and take it back to Budget. Then it suddenly stops. Metrocom
      Center - a call comes in for an officer down emergency. They radio Jack
      and he takes off. A cop got run over at Circus Circus, but they don't know
      if it's a real cop or security. He pulls up and Officer Frank Janise is
      down on the street with a stream of blood coming from his head. One man
      keeps him down, another holds his hand. Jack calls for an ETA on EMS. More
      people arrive and they caught the older male driver who hit him and has no
      license. EMS cuts Frank's jacket off. A witness says he had to chase the
      driver down the street. He wasn't sure what the guy was doing, he was
      trying to make up his mind what to do. He stopped and the man reached in
      and grabbed his keys. They think he's drunk and give him a field test.
      There was a DWI accident scene and Frank was there. The drunk ran through
      the scene and hit him. He's arrested for felony DWI because of the
      drinking and the injuries. They take Frank to University Medical Center
      for lacerations to his head, broken ribs and broken wrist. He was
      investigating a DWI and stopped traffic, the suspect drove through the
      accident scene, hit Frank and he went to leave. A guard chased him down
      and made him come back. (Seven Months Later) Officer Frank Janise talks
      about the accident. He arrived at the accident scene and went to get
      flares and find out about getting blood drawn for BAC. That's the last
      thing he remembers. He was told the man came across the Industrial road,
      went over the double line and hit him. The mirror on the truck hit him in
      the head and something cut through his shirt, jacket and vest. (5:50 PM
      Accident Call) He goes to where another cop has a man stopped and thinks
      he's drunk. Officer David Wagner explains the guy was making a westbound
      turn on Paradise, then a lady hit the back of the cab, plus there's a
      second accident. He gives the man a field test. Frank talks to the woman.
      She says the man sandwiched the guy between the truck and the cab almost
      killing him. (8:10 PM Accident Call) He goes to the call of a three car
      accident where paramedics have already arrived. He pulls up and the scene
      is full of people. He talks to a blonde woman who says the white car tried
      to make a left hand turn and the red car didn't yield. The white car's
      front is smashed in and the red car looks like a tinfoil ball. He can
      relate to them better because he was never involved in a DWI accident
      until he was hit. Everyone had seatbelts except for one lady in an 85
      Oldsmobile who only got lacerations. The driver was lucky he had his belt
      on so he survived. The old saying is if you drink, don't drive. (6:40 PM

      been assigned to the downtown area as a foot patrol officer. They run into
      a lot of homeless, a lot of robberies, find that a lot of their suspects
      come from in other cities. Then they find out they are also wanted back
      home, it's a very transient area. A red car is driving around a parking
      lot and they ask them what is the woman doing in the trunk of the
      hatchback and tell him to stop. He pulls over and they ask him why she is
      there. They were trying to get a room but it was $25. She has an
      Australian accent and says she's rode 5000 miles back there, that's why
      her leg is sore. The driver says he's rode back there. Officer Joseph
      Lombardo says he wouldn't ride there. Everything she owns is inside there
      and they laugh about it. (7:10 PM Domestic Disturbance) A woman is
      supposed to be holding a baby on the street and park rangers have her.
      They pull up and she is gone. The ranger points to where they went. They
      are across four lanes of traffic. Joe walks over and there is a man, woman
      and kid standing there. Cindy is upset, says her husband beat her and the
      cops let him go again. He's drunk and has a warrant out for his arrest.
      She's putting tape on a large cardboard box on the ground. Her husband
      knew she didn't have any money, thinks he went home and left her there.
      The guy with her is a stranger who gives her some money. He says it won't
      help much, but she shouldn't be out here like that. Her daughter is two
      and she told him she was going back to her parents in Phoenix. He was
      going to take her to get her check and he dropped her off there and left.
      He wants her to go and he told her so. She has no money, except what the
      guy gave her. She was going to get $128 from her check and Greyhound bus
      tickets as $32. Cops take her box, put it in their trunk and will go to
      Greyhound, they have some money. They drive her to the huge bus terminal
      and ask when the next bus is to Phoenix. It's 12:15am. They buy her a

      down one way streets with no way to turn around. Conrail loaned them a
      surveillance van used in Boston. Chief Inspector Art Dunn from the Conrail
      PD shows it off on the inside. Zenith gave them empty VCR, camcorder and
      TV boxes and they are glued and taped together to look flush. The giant
      crate on the left side is where the cops hide and it opens up to block the
      thieves in by wedging against the with a board on the floor. It's set up
      nice so they'll run inside and grab the equipment. They are in back of the
      projects. Officer Paul is driving the 18 wheeler Trailvan and pretends he
      broke down. He gets out, pops the hood and a black guy comes right up to
      him, then Paul leaves it. Seconds later three black kids come up to break
      the seal with a stick. (5:15 PM Truck Interior) Officer Andrew Lancellotti
      explains to the rest how many will come in and then they can open it.
      There's a bathroom and a long bench to sit inside the large crate. The kid
      in a white shirt and red shorts goes back to get a broom to break the
      seal. They are so excited when they get in and run saying
      &quot;VCRs!!&quot; Police jump them and they are surprised. They say
      they'll drive it over to Duncan and Sgt. Walter Barrett follows them over.
      They explain to Paul which way to turn and open the hood so they can see
      it better then he walks away from the truck. (7:55 PM) A black kid in
      white shorts works on the lock. He gets it open and excitedly signals his
      friends to come. When one joins him they jump them, but the second guy
      gets away. The first guy says they made him do it. When they pull him out
      of the truck a group of women laugh at him. He says he's 14. It starts to
      get dark so they call it off. He says they'll meet up and get them out of
      the back and they are thankful. Tomorrow they'll start earlier. Captain
      Bobby Martin says they did a good job yesterday and will do it again
      today. It's a big industry, a billion dollars a year of theft. They are
      going back to Duncan. We see cops have to enter the crate from a trapdoor
      in the bottom of the truck. They stop near a park and call the truck. They
      tell him to turn the nose their way. He pops the hood and fiddles with the
      engine to make it look good. He goes in and grabs his briefcase and walks
      away. (3:30 PM) There is a large pack of black men across the street. One
      of them grabs a screwdriver and heads over as another becomes a lookout.
      The guy gets the lock off and madly jumps in and is grabbed. The others

      they are setting up again. There are only certain streets in the city
      designated for trucks and people will steer them the wrong way so they can
      rob them. The move the truck to a new street. (6:15 PM) Four guys appear
      and one goes in the cab. A Hispanic man in a white hat pops the seal and
      calls to his buddies &quot;VCRehs!&quot; He grabs one, they jump him and
      drop out the bottom and grab the others. He says he has no dope on him,
      his hat comes off on the way out and says he's the only one to blame. He
      uses a hand pumper as the tool. It took only six minutes for them to park
      and break in. Captain Bobby Martin says they do a lot of proactive and
      reactive stuff patrolling hot areas where there are purse snatchings and
      house entries. Where there is bad crime they will set up and let them do
      the crime and catch them in the act, they are the witnesses in court. It's
      not a victim, it's the police as witnesses, so 9 times out of 10 they'll
      cop a deal. (12:10 AM Suspicious Situation) They spot Rob going in and out
      of a super market with a bag in the pouring rain. The bag was empty at
      first, now it's full. They watch him for a while to see where he goes. He
      goes up 5th and they stop him in the street. They ask if he bought the
      stuff, but he has no receipts. He threw them away and has no money left.
      He has 20 packs of cigarettes. Rob looks familiar to them and they ask him
      if he got busted for breaking into a car. He says he doesn't do that
      stuff, but they did bust him 2 1/2 weeks ago. They saw him outside the
      Pathmark for 20-30 minutes and go back to the store to see if he bought
      them. A manager says he saw Rob there, but he didn't buy anything. Officer
      Andrew Lancellotti asks if can they ID the stuff. The cigarettes have a
      4004 number on them that is the code for the store. He was running around,
      that why he didn't have a receipt. He stashed a bag by the diner and came
      back and grabbed more and went back. He was waiting for the rain to let
      up. He was there since 11 PM. Special thanks to Chief Richard J. Harrison. #319.

      City – The Sgt. tells officers the Puerto Rican parade goes down to
      Grundy Park so give it special attention. That's it. One cop says he’s
      on motorcycle 56. Officer Thomas Porter says what he likes most is the
      people he's with, they are a rare breed, not many people like to work at
      midnight and sleep all day. His partner is Officer Robert Falconetti who
      says there is less traffic, it’s more informal, a different class of
      people and is best shift in the city (Saturday 11:56 PM Assault Call)
      Thomas says there are lots more violent crimes, it's not Mayberry. They go
      up to Daisy who says her boyfriend Ruben Trinidad punched her in the head
      and scratched her with a knife. He took the keys and dropped the knife.
      He's riding a bike, in a white t-shirt, black shorts and a blue Morley's
      hat. They know him and go to a park where he hangs out. He's been arrested
      before, everyone knows him, not a great guy, every cop and everyone in
      town knows him. He'll probably come back, he's stupid enough to. There are
      a bunch of guys sitting at a table who say Ruben left an hour or so ago.
      They talk to Mike on a corner who says he hasn't seen him all day as a
      pack of people behind him make noise. They say to call if he sees them and
      go back to Daisy and her friends to see if he came back. She needs to go
      to 762 Montgomery St. on Monday to file a complaint unless they catch him
      first. He'll come back, he's cocky. (Thursday, 9:40 PM Assault Call) They
      get a call of a female being assaulted right where Daisy was last time. It
      turns out she is Daisy. A woman says he tried to get her again, busted his
      eye open and he's out inn the back yard. They go out there and it's
      totally dark. Ruben is down on the ground by an underground door. He was
      trying to climb into a window to escape, fell and hit his head. He's
      Mexican, with a big dorag. He says, “I can't stand up, I'm dizzy yo.”
      Tom is going to cuff him and Ruben says he's tough, he'll show him how
      tough he is even when he's cuffed. Tom says he's tough too. Ruben says
      he's a punk, he can't beat him one on one. Daisy says she didn't want to
      be with him once he got drunk. They were all hanging out together and then
      it got bad. She is holding ice on her face and doesn't care what they do
      to him now. They are charging him with assault. He says he doesn't need to
      be charged with that. He ends everything with yo and curses them out. He
      says he can curse all he wants and is going to court on Monday for beating
      up a cop and didn't resist. They have him in a cage and ask him to spell
      his name and he says to make sure they spell it right, like Trinidad and
      Tobago. He hangs all over, that's why they can't find him. He's been
      locked up many times, has an extensive record, no girls like him and they
      reject him so he beats them up. She signed a complaint on him and the
      state has the toughest domestic violence laws in the country. Orange, NJ
      (10:20 PM Street Patrol) Officer Dennis Vega says most of the time he
      winds up doing what he's taught, not on the job, but when you were
      younger, how to treat people and how to react in different situations. If
      you get physical that doesn't solve things it creates new problems. If you
      fight with everyone you are not going to make it, this is not the job for
      it. A black guy flags him down and says his cousin has a problem with his
      sister and his kids. He says there is going to be a fight, but he can't
      explain it. He wants Dennis to go there, but he won't until he
      understands. He says the cousin and his ex are fighting over their kid and
      he'll ride down there on the hood if he wants. It started right there and
      now they're by the ice cream parlor. He says he's a short bald f--ker. The
      guy runs down there and Dennis meets him at the corner. A woman says the
      guy is lying on Bell Street all beat up. A witness says a guy beat him up
      and left him there. The guy is on his back spread out and mumbling. He
      indicates he can't breathe and can't move his leg. He starts crying and
      screaming. Dennis calls an ambulance. The cousin holds him down. The guy
      starts screaming and moving his legs because he wants him off him. He
      wants him to shut up. He keeps trying to get up and T holds him down. EMS
      arrives and T wants them to help, but the victim doesn't want their help,
      he can do it his own way, so Dennis calls them off. They started fighting
      on Jefferson St., he got bopped, is probably on the pipe and couldn't
      fight his way out of a paper bag. There was nothing the police could do
      about it, just can't let it get out of control and won't solve anything

      Hoboken - Officer Mike Plunkett became an officer for the same reason most
      people do - to change the world, be somebody’s knight in shining armor,
      rid the city of all crime. It's a good attitude to have when you first
      come on, you need that, but when you’re on the streets a few weeks the
      reality check is you won't be a knight on shining armor, you can't change
      the streets and the best you can do is make your world a little better.
      When you retire you'll have a pretty good career to look back on. If you
      can survive 25 years you've got it made. It’s usually around the time
      when the bars start closing and there are a lot of problems. They
      centralize themselves in the areas where the bars are in case of problems.
      He pulls up to a bunch of guys fighting on a sidewalk. Two groups separate
      as one man in a blue shirt fights and a cop grabs him. A citizen takes his
      cuffs and cuffs the guy. His friend wants to take him home. They say too
      late, he’s under arrest. They say some guys threw him around and tossed
      him out. Ten guys did it, but they didn’t get thrown out. Why is getting
      arrested, they came out and found him? He assaulted a cop. Mike says he
      listened to him, now he can go home. How can he, that guy is his ride. He
      doesn’t care. Det. Brian Murphy says they went to take him out and he
      got loud and abusive and didn’t want to listen and pushed him around, he
      didn’t get hurt, just winded. Mike talks to the suspect at the station.
      He says he had his drinks, no problems, was having a good time. Then
      somebody said something to him, he came back, said something again. Then
      bing bang boom he hit the guy, but he didn’t know he was a cop or he
      wouldn’t have touched him. He should’ve looked first. He’s sure Mike’s
      been in a position like that before. No. You won’t admit it. He then
      realized he was a cop. Maybe you had too much to drink. I did. He can live
      with that. After Mike asks how could he not know he was a cop, he was in
      full uniform. It wasn’t like he was wearing a Good Humor uniform. He was
      blind drunk. He’ll get a summons, be home in an hour, should spend a
      weekend in county jail, maybe he’ll think twice before whacking a cop
      again. Jersey City (Narcotics Unit Briefing) Sgt. Brian McDonough says
      they caught a girl with cocaine and she told them there was a house with
      two Spanish chicks selling cocaine out of there. They have a warrant and
      it’s the top apartment #129. Sgt. Edwin Gillen says she’s an old heavy
      woman, over 50, maybe 45. Brian explains how they will go up and batter
      the door, it’s the weekend, don’t get hurt for it. Det. Dennis
      DeSefano says they are Medellin and laughs. (11:45 PM Service of Warrant)
      He says when they see the last man go in, Mike, go down the block and
      cover the sides of the building in case something comes out the window.
      They go up, knock, say ‘Policia’, then ram the door. A woman can be
      heard. Inside there are babies crying, they grab the woman and make her
      sit, they find an older woman, a man and three babies they secure. Dennis
      grabs wads of cash that are in a purse. They also find a welfare bundle of
      cash. The government is good to them. She laughs. They search her and make
      the family speak to her in Spanish and tell her to turn over any drugs or
      weapons. They also find a room of stolen clothes, all still have tags on
      them, enough for a 100 people. It’s like doing inventory for JC Penney.
      One has a tag for $50. They rob stores and trade them for drugs. Six
      suitcases full of kids shoes, a $75 David Benjamin dress, his wife doesn’t
      wear those and $60 pants. The woman in yellow says she likes it, she uses
      it. Good country, eh? The kids all scream and now they are worried about
      the kids when they are taking them out for locking up the grandmother. He’s
      worried about the kids while they deal. They see that and hate the cops,
      he would too if he was a kid. Brian says the grandmother was hiding in the
      closet with a couple grams of coke, she was the one in charge. They have a
      little bit of drugs and a lot of money, a lot of jewelry too. The daughter
      is in the cage yelling. They find an Irish good luck ring are any of them
      Irish? Did you go to St. Michael’s High School in 1972? It’s not the
      families jewelry it’s someone else’s. Jersey City (11:50 PM) Officer
      Thomas Porter gets out of his car at a park that overlooks the NYC skyline
      with the World Trade Center. They park everywhere, but there’s a fire
      pump they block. He has to chase them away to get them to park somewhere
      else. (12:21 AM Stolen Car Call) He gets in his car and they give chase on
      the Pulasky Skyway into Newark. Officer Robert Falconetti drives. A cop
      tells them they are ‘crazy Marty.’ They stop on a bridge, get out and
      run. Sirens are heard down the road. They are supposed to be around
      somewhere. They look over the bridge thinking he went over, but he didn’t
      jump, he was hanging over the side. They ask the guy they caught where do
      your friends live. On High St. in Jersey City. They go down and look up.
      They were chased down the ramp and one of the guys is hiding in the weeds
      somewhere. There was an accident the police were handling and they were
      trapped with nowhere to go so one guy jumped off the ramp, but who knows.
      (Street Patrol) Cops go to a lot where kids robbed a truck full of candy.
      Kids are dumping candy in a lot. The people say there wasn’t much
      before, then they saw them come around and dump some more. They ask what
      kind of truck it was. They are from the factory back there, it’s a white
      truck. It’s a candy caper. Thomas jokes for them to be under arrest and
      they all do and laugh. They doubt the thief will come back and the kids
      are having a ball with it, the candy is probably bad, but they’ll let
      them have fun with it. (1:47 AM) They find a car turned on its side. They
      parked it in front of a gate that reads, “No No No parking Anytime” in
      white spray paint. They got mad at them so the cops help out and turn the
      car back over. Over the credits is the mother daughter drug team at the

      Now he chooses prevention. If you can wake someone up before they get in
      the system, then you've done more than the system can do. It starts
      raining hard as a man is interfering with a baby. They are outside and the
      mother gave the baby to the dad who is a drunk with a flat top. He says he
      drinks, but is not a drunk. She is drunk and mouthing off that she works
      hard. Thomas is mad, he says the kid should be inside and should be taken
      to child protective services. The witness says that's why he called.
      Thomas says forget this and they chase after them to take the kid. The
      mother flips out, fights, get hysterical and the dad asks can't he take
      her home? They take the kid to the station and will lock the parents up.
      Officer Kim Braddock holds the baby. Thomas tells the dad to permit it is
      the same as doing it. The witness says he tried to get the carriage up
      over the curb and it fell twice and the kid fell out both times. The
      original witness is also there and saw them drunk and fighting. They were
      in a bar drinking with the kid and passed the kid off to some derelict so
      they could fight. Child Youth Services is advised so a relative can be
      called. Thomas talks to the mom and says she needs to put the baby's well
      being ahead of her fun. She says her baby is with her, she takes the baby
      with her when she goes drinking since she can't get a babysitter. She says
      if she wants to go out with her man, that's fine. Thomas says she isn't
      getting it. She says if the kid fell why come she not bruised. Tom says
      she fell out twice, god was watching them. #324. 3/9/91</td>

      Officer Vickie Thomas is at home getting her gear ready for work. Her job
      is very exciting, going out dealing with the scum as the mayor would call
      them. She never knows what to expect, be prepared for anything, likes a
      good fight, it gets the adrenaline pumping, likes to get in there, roll
      around, give her a fight any day. She gets in her car and drives to work.
      Sgt. Jim Diamond says they are going to do a buy/bust operation and they
      have two women in the car, so take care of them. Vickie is a single mom
      with a six year old son and likes these busts because they are dangerous
      and exciting. If she was to die her son would be a very rich little boy
      because she has lots of insurance. They decide to focus on one area
      because they are losing light. Vickie stops and asks a young girl for a
      dime. She asks them if they are vice and only has a small piece because
      she doesn't know them. She hands it to them and they check it out and wind
      up buying it. They try to say they've seen her around, she says they don't
      look like vice and the guys don't want her to sell it. She has a blue
      skirt and a red doorag on and goes back in the Honky Tonk. They drive over
      there and catch her. Vickie feels sorry for her, but she's glad to get
      them off the street because they don't care who they sell too like 8, 9 or
      10 year olds. (5:05 PM) They make another stop. There are some guys
      hanging around and they ask for a dime. They go back and get a guy who
      comes back with a rock. They give it to them, they taste it and say
      someone sold them wax on the other side of town. The guy asks her if she
      wants a boyfriend. She says no, but that he is kinda cute. They ask if
      they are cops and they say they wouldn't do them like that. She radios it
      in, they are caught and they find a pill canister filled with $20 pieces.
      She feels sorry for the girls who are trying to support 4-5 kids, but the
      guys she has no pity for and will bust them all day every day if she can.
      (4:43 PM Man with Gun Call) Officer Micki Mashburn has a bad died blond
      mullet and short spiky hair. She has worked this area for over 5 years.
      You get to know the area and the people, they know when you are on or off
      shift and when they can commit crimes. They sell drugs and quit when she
      comes on duty. There is a suspect standing on Ford and Mitchell, possibly
      armed. It was called in by someone who knows him. He is walking near a
      place called Checkers with four guys there. She calls him over, checks him
      and he has no ID. He is all fidgety and says he doesn’t live there and
      is visiting his grandma, but doesn't know her address. She lives over
      there. He has a beeper, says the guys are his partners and has no answer
      why he doesn't carry ID. She puts him in the back of the car and goes over
      to the wall where they were hanging out and finds drugs behind it. There
      is a canister of rocks and Quaaludes. The guys are on another corner and
      she asks if they want to claim it and they say no. The charge is with the
      guy in the red shirt. Mark arrives as back up and she wants him to search
      the suspect, especially if he shoved something in his crotch area.
      (Airport Narcotics Unit) Sgt. Danny Long has information from the FBI and
      a photo of someone who is supposed to be flying out of Tampa and carrying
      narcotics, unknown what kind. They have their names and they are on the
      manifest. Detective James Contento asks if it's in the luggage or on them,
      but they don't know. They walk over to the Delta check in and are in plain
      clothes. They spot and follow them to the stairs and check the guy at the
      bottom. They ask if they can talk to him and if they can search his bag.
      The woman he is with asks if he's in trouble for flying under a different
      name. Detective James Quinn searches too. They find a joint which she says
      she forgot was there. They bring in the dog and then search their clothes.
      They find a large bag of pot and tell her they'll bring a female officer
      to search her. She says they just bought the pot to smoke it and are not
      dealers. She is under arrest, it's a felony possession. They say they can
      put her husband on another flight, but she says she is staying with him.
      They find pills on her and she says they are diet pills, but has no
      prescription and got them from a friend. She says she's overweight, lost
      40 pounds and has people ask her if she's pregnant all the time. The
      husband takes her stuff and leaves. She says it's a chance for him to be a

      leak and water on the floor. They ask the guy how tall his friend is. He
      says he has a tool on him from work. They ask if his job is a burglar. He
      says no. They find money on him and he says he wants it back because it's

      think it's supposed to be and they all think they are right. He says it's
      in the Suitcase City area where everyone moves around so much. There is
      another cop there and a Chevy Caprice in the driveway. The call is the
      husband is harassing her by pulling up and knocking on the door. Deputy
      Jeff Samberg is there. David says she is 29 and he goes to church and he's
      trying to get her to come with him and she won't. He doesn't want her to
      commit adultery again. He calls her and the family hangs up on him. He
      hangs out in front of the house yelling for her to come out. He wants her
      to come out and he'll buy her cigarettes and help her out. They are
      married, but separated. She is obsessive compulsive and he just wants her
      to come to counseling with him. He loves Debbie, wants to take her to
      dinner, wants to be with his wife on Saturday night, he'll buy her lobster
      or shrimp. Mike says he's been there before, knows they have lots of cats
      and wonders if his strategy has worked before. It sounds weird that he's
      trying to barter with cigarettes and shrimp. The morbidly obese mother
      tells him she doesn't want him around anymore. If he comes back he'll be
      arrested for trespassing. They write it up. Debbie comes out, is taller
      than David and asks if he has any cigarettes on him. She can't leave
      because she doesn't trust him, he'll hurt her. He says he'll never hurt
      her. Robin filed the trespass, not her. He has to pick her up in the
      street then. She says she'll go with him and talk, she owes him that much.
      First no one wanted to be around, then they are leaving together. Mike

      the only calls his squad answers on the radio are fatal accidents or
      damage to a city vehicle. There are certain times of the year they focus

      wants him to walk - 9-10 steps heel to toe. Mr. Lee walks 6 steps, almost
      falls over and says you got me on that one. He is arrested. John spots a
      car driving all over the road on Independence and Memorial. The guy gets
      out and he asks him to see his license. He says he doesn't have it with
      him. He has one, then admits he doesn't have one. He doesn't know why,
      then he says it's suspended. John says he was weaving. He says his
      girlfriend is horny, was grabbing on him and he only had 8 beers. The
      woman says she only had a couple. John takes him to the station to give
      him a breathalizer test and Officer Lyman D. Graham tests him. He has to
      blow into a tube hard for about 15 seconds. Impaired is point .10, his
      first is point .11 and his second is .10 so he's legally impaired. They go

      means they've been dead 12-18 hours. They find blood on the side of the
      fridge and possibly gunpowder. (7:12 AM) They remove the bullet from the
      man after they've been there 12-14 hours. They come up with a dozen
      theories to what happened, one may be right, but they'll never know.
      Moreno Valley, CA (Gun Range) Sheriff's Dept - Deputy Duke Viveros fires
      at a target, reloads and is told to shoot 12 rounds into the last target
      line. Every three months they need to go down to the range and shoot a 210
      score. If they fail they have to make it up. Not everyone shoots as much
      as they should and they'll regret it later when they get docked pay. He
      takes a call and pulls up to Maurice standing outside of his car. He tells
      him to put his hands up and he had a problem the other night. He says he
      didn't. Duke opens the trunk and there's a huge speaker inside. Maurice
      says he talked to her parents, told them he's 18, she's 14, they
      understood that. They thought he was going to rape her, he says he's not
      like that. They went to a party, she got drunk and said she was so horny
      in front of five guys. Deputy Heidi Godfrey says it's illegal for him to
      have sex with her. He knows, but she insisted saying she was ready. He
      didn't want to at first, but she assured him no one would find out. He
      says she wasn't drunk last night and he bought her an expensive ring. She
      says she loves him a lot, doesn't care if she got pregnant and wants kids.
      He asked for the ring back after what she did last night. Then she got mad
      and accused him of rape last night. He has two marks on his neck, she gave
      him a hickey and he gave one back. He says if it's love age shouldn't
      matter. They explain it's the law. He's arrested for unlawful intercourse
      with a minor. He's not thinking about being with an underage girl
      drinking, getting drunk and having sex. #329. 4/27/91</td>

    <td width="811" height="1"><b>Houston, TX 2</b>   (10:08 PM Disturbance
      Call) Sheriff's Dept - Deputy Eugene Lancaster works the unicorporated
      parts of Harris county, in the last few years crime has gotten a lot
      worse, mostly drugs, especially crack. They’re undermanned and always
      busy. A man is breaking windows with a pipe. Eugene goes up the dark
      driveway to a rundown house. A woman says her boyfriend done beat the
      windows in and took off. She saw him throw a ladder through a window and
      broke three others and the air conditioner. She was over his house and her
      car died and he left her there. They pushed the car to Circle K and the
      tow truck driver brought her home. He did it because he was drunk and
      thinks she's screwing around with the neighbor. They have two kids
      together and her grandfather lives with her and Eugene explains to her
      what to do if she wants to file charges. There is a gun on the table and
      Eugene holds it as he explains it. They guy isn't there, so he can't
      arrest him. They'll have to sign a statement saying he did it. Suddenly
      shots are fired in the yard. He calls for backup 42-40 and then runs out
      and hunts the guy down. He is in the yard in a red shirt and jeans. He
      tells him to get down and cuffs him. He says not to move, to shut up and
      asks him where the gun is. He says he has no gun. Eugene searches for it
      and tells him to shut up. He calls in that the guy is in custody. The
      woman comes down smoking and wanting the two jackets he's wearing saying
      they are hers. The man says he drank a 12 pack of beer and a pint of
      whiskey - that's it. He doesn't care anymore, doesn't smoke crack. As they
      are driving back to the station a torrential rains starts. He says he was
      filing a criminal mischief report, got shot at, it scared him to death and
      was not a good feeling. He didn't see the guy, made a run for it and
      caught him. (11:22 PM) They arrive at the station, take the first door on
      the right and Cpl Jim Haley questions him. The drunk says that his
      girlfriend got him disappointed and no woman in the world should get you
      disappointed when you are drinking trying to have a good time. When the
      car breaks down and they blame you that isn't right. He's not an alcoholic
      or anything, he doesn't like it, that's the way he is that's the way it's
      gonna be! That's the way he grew up and that's the way it's gonna be. He
      gets angry. You don't know where he grew up or where comes from. You don't
      and nobody else will. It makes him mad. He's worse than Rambo. He doesn't
      use a gun. He's the only one who can change it. He doesn't smoke crack. He
      is an alcoholic, he drinks the cheap whiskey. He is dying anyway of
      cirrhosis of the liver, but no one believes him. He's been through a
      stomach staple, he's been through hell, more than Rambo. He can't stop, he
      can't stop today, why should he? He ain't never tried to kill anyone or
      hurt anyone, he did break some teenie windows. Whenever he gets out he's
      not going to stop. As long as she treats him wrong he'll treat her like sh-t.
      If she treats him right, he'll treat her right. They've been together for
      4 years. He has 2 kids - 2 years and 4 months and 8 months. He hopes his
      kids see this so they'll be worse than him. He knows his one boy will be
      worse, he hopes he is. A man won't take sh-t from a woman. He doesn't want
      people messing with him when he has a good time. He says he doesn't drink
      that much, when someone gets him pissed off he gets pissed off. Jim asks
      shim if he wants help for his drinking. He says he doesn't need help, he
      just pissed off, it would be throwing money out the window. He cries and
      says he loves his kids, he could've got shot. Then he asks if it will cost
      anything. He says counseling is free and he admits he needs help. (2:52 AM
      Disturbance Call) Harris County Sheriff's Dept - it's lunchtime. They are
      stuffing hot dogs down. Deputy Michael Sieck says his partner Deputy Bubba
      Hinton wears a hat, but his head is too big to fit in the car. Bubba says
      he's a native Texan and he likes wearing a cowboy hat, it goes natural
      with him. They take separate cars and hope it'll be a quiet call. Karen
      says for the guy to tell them. The guy says he rents a room to a friend
      and they got into a fight over the renter's woman. He has no shirt on and
      the guy has no pants on. The woman says the owner wants to sleep with her.
      The renter says the owner hit him in the face. She asks the owner to tell
      the truth that he came to her house and harassed her. She says not to turn
      his dad gum back on her. She has a 20 month old son and doesn't want to
      deal with it. All three of them smoke. Bubba says a tenant has rights and
      he has a right to have a woman over. The owner doesn't want her there. The
      renter says he wants her there. Bubba says she has to leave or she can
      leave with them. Bubba says if Karen doesn't leave he can arrest them all.
      She goes to leave and curses the owner out. Mike says 'he's fixin to jail
      her'. She gets so mad because he wants to screw her and she just wants to
      be friends. Mike says she shouldn't come over there and flaunt it front of
      him. She says she's not flaunting it. He says it's a figure of speech,
      she's in front of him. She says she didn't like him because he had no
      front teeth and was ugly looking. #332. 5/18/91</td>

      Harris County Sheriff’s Dept. – Deputy Monty Herron has been around
      horses his whole life. He’s owned one for 15 years to relieve stress. He
      belongs to the rodeo association of Texas police officers and they travel
      around the state competing for buckles. He goes to a call of 5 or 6 black
      males at a burglary in progress. When he gets there it is a shooting. A
      man is hit in the chest and a woman in the leg. They go into a dark house
      with a woman blocking the way. The guy says someone tried to break in
      through the window and he shot them. His wife tried to escape through the
      front when shotgun blasts came through their bedroom window and they can
      see holes in a picture on the wall. There is blood everywhere. Cops say it
      was really a dope deal gone sour and the victims were hit with 9mm. They secure the scene for Detective Pratt. (11:17 PM Shots Fired Call)&nbsp;

      the females harder to make them better. A
      female heard several shots and someone screaming for help. While looking

      illegal, but just gives him a warning.&nbsp; (1:18 AM Theft Call) Deputy Michael Sieck likes the

      block of Kokomo. They cuff the long haired driver for stealing the $16
      worth of gas. The owner followed them and is on the scene. The passenger
      went in for cigarettes and the driver was supposed to go in and pay, but
      ran. The driver doesn’t know anything about it. They take the driver
      back to the gas station to get ID’ed by the clerk. Mike says if he tells
      the truth he’ll only get a citation. The driver says he only had $1, so
      he pumped and ran away. He gets a $200 fine and is let go until the trial.

      she wouldn't give it back to him. There were 3 shots fired, but she says
      it wasn't fired. They can tell that it was fired, so she says she believes
      them. They pull the guy out of the cop car and he says the woman is his
      fiancé, the gun is his, they were arguing and he shot it in the air twice
      because he was mad and he threw it away. He is upset she is getting
      arrested. He wants to know how much it will cost. They are both arrested
