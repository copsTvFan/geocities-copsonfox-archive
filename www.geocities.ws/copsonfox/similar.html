      bodies are found in the river stuffed with drugs and money. Drug dealers
      were working with cops to raid boats known with drugs, but the cops were
      rogue and were dealing. They made over a million each on one raid. 12/85 -
      The Miami River Cops were caught. All were Mexican. Alex Alvarez says they
      wanted to get rich, why could drug dealers have everything? 1/87 – the
      verdict came through that most were innocent. It ended in a mistrial.
      Riverias made a deal and spoke about 70 dirty cops. They tried to kill the
      witnesses. Eventually they all got up to 35 years. Clarence Dickson says
      there is so much temptation and it will get through. 10% of their cops
      were found corrupt. Los Angeles, LA 3/3/91 – Rodney King is beaten.
      Daryl Gates says it’s reasonable and necessary force, but who makes that
      determination. He was a cop for 43 years and believed the force was
      unnecessary. Rodney says he was glad he wasn’t dead, they beat him where
      it hurt. Sgt. Stacey Koon, Lawrence Powell &amp; Timothy Winn were
      indicted. Ofc Jorge De Los Reyes said morale was down, it was depressing.
      Ira Reiner says people had less and less tolerance for violent criminals.
      The initial reaction is that person had it coming to him. King was on
      parole, drunk, ran from cops and had drugs. Two passengers surrendered,
      King charged them, tased him twice and he still fought. He stopped, then
      started fighting again. They are trained to use the batons to cause pain
      and stop them. King was big, 6’2” and heavy. They go for your guns,
      are bigger than you. Koon says he was impervious to pain, it was according
      to training, sometimes it’s brutal. Ofc Ted Briseno says he didn’t see
      any weapon, thought it was excessive and he tried to stop Powell. They ran
      the tape so many times it had no impact. 4/29/92 – they are found
      innocent. Then riots ensue and 1200 fires are started. 54 are killed. Then
      cops are accused of not using enough force. President Bush ordered a civil
      trial. Harland Braun says it became symbolic justice, there was no chance
      at a fair trial. This time King testified. Powell &amp; Koon were found
      guilty and got 30 months. 4/94 – King won $3 million. 1994</td>
