      Call) East District - Officer Genae Gehring says when she worked the Indy
      500 speedway the first time she had to direct it three times in because of
      rain and it is a lot of fun, you get to walk around the track and meet a
      lot of people. She backs up an officer involved in a foot pursuit in an
      area past the train tracks on North Drive. She asks a witness where he
      went. He's a black guy, gray shirt, blue jeans. She backs up and goes on
      Dearborn. A group of people there says he ran into their house and out the
      back door. She knows the guy, it's Dave. She runs on foot through yards
      and they tackle him on a lawn. He says he's down after three cops are
      sitting on him including Officer Richard Wilkerson. Then he says he can't
      breathe and they don't believe him. They find a bag of powder in his
      pocket and he claims it's just Kool Aid. They tell him it doesn't matter,
      he'll still get busted for selling drugs. He's under house arrest and has
      an ankle bracelet on. His mom shows up and they tell him he was driving a
      stolen car. She wants to know if he stole the truck too. Officer Frederick
      Hamer Jr. explains it to him. Mom asks him what the bags are and he says a
      variety store next to them sells the Kool Aid like that. Genae says that's
      not true. He keeps talking and mom tells him to shut up. They sprayed him
      with mace and he has to go to the hospital. He wants to know what he's
      charged with and says his eyes are suddenly clean. Marion County (4:02
      PM Traffic Accident) Sheriff's Dept - West District Deputy Mark Myler has
      been there long enough to arrest the children of criminals and now even
      their grandchildren He goes to an accident where a girl was hit by a truck
      and is stuck underneath it. He says you never get used to seeing children
      hurt. He talks to the driver who says he was going around the corner and
      the girl came out in front of him on a bike and he panicked and hit the
      gas instead of the brake, hit her and dragged her into a yard. The bike is
      stuck under the truck and the driver cries. The girl, Sam, doesn't want to
      go to the hospital, but Mark says she has to. EMS works on her. A witness
      saw it, but doesn't know if the guy did anything wrong. He says another
      guy saw it too and Mark says to go get him. Mark has the driver show him
      what happened in the street and then has him sit in his car. A maintenance
      man lifts the truck and pulled her out. EMS says her pressure is dropping
      and they need to get her to the hospital. Being dragged on the lawn
      probably saved her. She got a bump on the head and lots of scrapes. She is
      stable. Indianapolis - East District - Officer Richard Wilkerson says you
      don't hear thank you a lot out here, when you do it's really nice. He goes
      to a house for a domestic and knocks on the door. A scroungy guy comes up
      and says someone called, but it's OK now. The guy who called doesn't live
      there. He sounds drunk and then says they guy who called is in the
      bathroom. He picks up some booze in the back and Rich tells him to put it
      down. He says he will after he drinks a sip. If anyone did anything wrong
      it was him, but he didn't do anything. Rich goes into the bathroom and
      there is a guy there with a bloody face. He says the drunk punched him
      twice. They go out and cuff the drunk and he says the guy punched himself
      in the eye. Officer Robert Hipple Jr. backs him up. The drunk says he
      fell, then he says it was self-defense. Rob questions the victim who says
      he told him to leave because his girlfriend left. Then he got mad, called
      911 and then he punched him 3 times. He doesn't need an ambulance, but if
      it gets bad he'll go to the hospital. The drunk guy says he likes him and
      would die for any of them. Then he says he doesn't like the victim that
      much. They take him out and the victim tells them to take his Wild Irish
      Rose too. They pour it out. The drunk says to just take him home and Rich
      says he can't do that. He says he didn't hit the guy, but if he did hit
      him, he deserved it. Then he says he could overpower them all with a kung
      fu jujitsu flip. They ask what that is and he says not to worry about it.

    <td width="811" height="1"><b>Indianapolis, IN 9</b>  (2:32 AM Shooting
      Call) North District - Officer Andrew Stradling likes the state and the
      city. It's not a big city, so there isn't as many problems like New York.
      He takes a call, drives down an alley and a woman points to where the
      shooter is. There are four people down there including a big black man
      named Thomas who has been shot in the chest. He has his shirt off and is
      covering the bloody wound. Andrew tries to get him to sit down which he
      does, then he gets up. He says if he sits down it'll bleed less and keeps
      telling him to sit, he does again, then gets up again screaming about how
      much it hurts. He kicks a garbage can and keeps screaming. EMS is on the
      way and his girl keeps telling him to sit. He wants to go over to the fire
      department. He keeps saying it hurt and exhales sharply. He leans all over
      the police car and says he can't feel his heart. They wheel a cot over and
      he walks right by it because he wants to get in the ambulance. They bring
      him back and he says his back is burning and wants to know if there is a
      hole. He gets on the gurney, then tries to get up. The girl says they were
      drinking, having a good time and his brother Tyrone accused her of
      stealing from him and went and got his gun and he shot him. He does this
      every time he drinks. The bullet missed all the organs. Marion County, IN
      (5:32 PM Domestic Disturbance Call) Sheriff's Dept West District - Deputy
      David Whitesell has been about there 3 years, used to be a park ranger and
      likes working there. Two couples are arguing and their kids are fighting.
      A shirtless white man says the neighbors daughter Amy slapped his daughter
      Ashley and was beating on her back. The mom just sat and watched drinking
      a beer then threw it at him and hit him in the head. Deputy Brian Swinford
      backs him up. The mom says they threw coffee on her before. Amy says
      Ashley got on her lawn and mouthed off and she smacked her. Mom says
      Ashley hits her kid all the time, so she told her to hit her back and the
      neighbor's wife thinks she wants her husband, but she doesn't. This is the
      way of the trailer park - mom wanted to fight the other mom. Sgt. David
      Heilwagen comes and asks what Brian wants to do. Amy has a shirt that
      says, &quot;Just between us girls I'm gonna kick butt!&quot; They go back
      and tell them not to fight and to stay away from each other. They don't
      want anything to do with each other and they don't drink, she's the one
      that drinks. He doesn't want to get involved, he just wants to fish. They
      tell him not to confront her anymore. He say she does it in the park all
      the time and he won’t. Next time just call the police. (5:52 PM
      Assistance Call) Marion County Sheriff's Dept West District - Deputy Mark
      Myler says he's enjoyed being a deputy sheriff for 29 years and he tried
      to be a detective, but didn't like it. He wants to be on the street, on
      the front lines where the action is, trying to help people. Jeremy, a 7
      year old boy, locked his mom out of the house. Mark tries to get to him to
      open the door and he makes faces through the window with the broken
      blinds. Mom says this doesn't happen on a regular basis. She'll give a key
      to Phyllis the neighbor now. Mark says he can break a window on the door.
      Deputy David Whitesell says the kid is making faces at him. Mark gives
      Dave a credit card to try to get the door open, but it doesn't work. The
      kid comes up and makes faces while they do then goes to an open window,
      smiles at them, says no and closes the window. David goes around front to
      distract the kid while Mark strikes the window multiple times with a
      flashlight. The kid runs and hides and they have to search for him. He is
      under the bed and won't come out. Mark pulls the bed out and grabs the
      kid. He's in his underwear and screams and cries. They bring him to the
      living room and ask him why he did that. He growls and kicks at his mom.
      She admits having lots of problems with him. She called the cops two weeks
      ago to get him in the car at Kroger and Mark took that call. She says
      she's going to make his dad fix the window. Mark says Friday night in
      Indianapolis, all he's got to say. #1202. 1/15/00</td>

      for 5 years, has gotten to know a lot of people in the area, they know his
      name and say, &quot;Hey Badway!&quot; and he'll wave back. Officer Michael
      Riley says there is a lot of prostitution and drugs in the area, it's

      and he says, “There was a damn cop that didn't help him.&quot; What
      happened to his knee? He fell chasing him. He was in his truck, a man came
      over to him and he opened the window. He says everything he has in his
      wallet is gone. He wants to secure his semi-truck so the rest doesn't get
      stolen. He's parked next block over. All of his paperwork is in the
      wallet. He's a tall guy, dark hair, black pants, he doesn't have time for
      this, every document he's got is in his wallet. He doesn't know his name.
      He took off and he chased him to the light. What’s he look like? White
      guy, black hair, his height, his age. He wasn't in the truck with him, how
      many times does he have to say that? He pulled over to get some rest. He
      has tears in his stocking and bloody scrapes. Officer Charles Gravis backs
      them up. He saw a cop when he was chasing him and he wouldn't help. It's
      not right. He gets back in his cab and says if he finds him he'll kill
      him. He won't give his info so they say if they find his wallet they can't
      contact him. His toes are painted red, and he has on blue eyeshadow. The
      guy grabbed his wallet and took off, pulled it out the window, didn't get
      in. Joe wants to get dressed, he puts on a tank top, pink shorts and flip
      flops. They say based on the outfit he had on he was looking for

      it outside the truck. They find his wallet with his license, cards and
      cash, but two checks are missing, which is what he's most worried about.
      The thing is that son of a bitch stole his wallet, who's he gonna do it to
      next? He doesn't understand the law and drives away in his 18 wheeler. The
      other cop he saw had a prisoner and couldn't leave. They hope he feels
      better about the police than he did before. He's going to a different part
      of town, won't be back here. (2:02 AM Street Patrol) Southeast Area

      one woman walks away from him and won't listen. The second woman comes
      over to him and says the other woman scratched her. She keeps pushing her
      hair back and says he doesn't understand. She was outside and got pulled
      over. They both sit down and yell at each other. The white girl came back
      from the store and tried to get back in her room, but the black girl was
      there, but wasn’t supposed to be. She lives by herself and is totally
      wired. He calls a female officer to search her. She admits she has a pipe
      on her. Officer Debbie Hesley arrives to search her. She says the pipe is
      inside her pants and she's wearing boxer shorts. She says she's the one
      who gets all the blame and has to pay for the crime. She keeps squirming
      around and fidgeting with her hair. Says the pipe is all she has and is
      being honest with her. She takes her shoe off and drugs fall out of it.
      She says that wasn't in her shoe. If it was there, she would've felt it
      when she was walking. She says, “please officer - tonight's not my
      night.” She checks her socks and says it couldn't have been in her shoe,
      if you walk on it then it would crunch. It was a crack rock in the shoe.
      She didn't know it was there. The black girl has two pipes on her, but is
      just given citations. Crack takes over your life out here. (3:26 PM

      bloodstain on his shirt dripping down. Deputy Leif Arvidson backs him up.
      He says he's all right and they have him sit down. He was talking to his
      sister's fiancé and was drunk. He went in his room and then he started
      swinging the knife at him. He had it on him, just freaked. His sister left
      with the guy. They live at the apartments right behind him. They go over
      there and a nasty looking white woman is freaking out, hyperventilating.
      She goes down, can't speak, says she saw the stabbing, please, I'm going
      back home, can't stand it anymore. They catch the shirtless suspect around
      the corner and a woman with him. They are cuffed and mirandized. The
      husband comes over to comfort his wife Rhonda who can't breathe. The
      suspect says he hit him, he didn't do nothing. He was hit three times in
      the last month, who hit him today? He doesn't know. Who stopped him? He
      doesn't know what happened at the apartment. He didn't do anything with
