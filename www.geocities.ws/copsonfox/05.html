      Sheriff's Dept. - Deputy Bill Cassio says people victimize each other left
      and right and sometimes thinks everyone is a bad guy. He knows he's
      getting cynical when he thinks there are no victims. The world is made up
      of two types of people - victims and suspects. A man was walking along and
      Marcus stopped him and they fought in the street. He then shoots the man
      and takes off. His car and girlfriend are still on the scene. The K9 and
      cops find two guys at a house and the black guy who was a witness is
      brought over and says the shirtless guy was the one. He denies everything
      saying the victim asked him for a ride and he said no, so he got mad and
      fought with him and then got shot, but he didn't shoot him. He said
      &quot;Damn&quot; and left. It turns out he was a rival gang member and he
      just shot him dead in the heart. Olympia WA (6:17 PM Kidnapping Call) A
      person saw a car driven by Bruce pull over, breaks the car window, pull
      Debbie out the window and take off. He is her husband and the cop knows
      the couple and she has a protection order against him. She got out a
      couple blocks later and walks backed to the scene all bloody with cuts on
      her head, hand and foot. They take her to the hospital and arrest him ten
      minutes later. They are getting divorced and he went nuts. He's been
      stalking her and went to her job the week before. King Co WA (8:14 PM Man
      with a Gun Call) Mike Smith had his shotgun and chased a Spanish kid on a
      baseball field. When cops pull up to his apartment he is home and barely
      coherent. He says he was robbed and was trying to get even. His apartment
      is loaded with guns, knives and swords which he says are all antiques.
      They arrest him for public intoxication and take him to detox for the
      night. His friend comes over to take the guns. #504. 12/5/92</td>

      Being a cop lets you do everything you tune in to the 10 o'clock news to

      every ride in the park. It's a ball, loves being involved in stuff and
      really enjoys getting to help people. 2 1/2 years ago a lady gave birth in
      a car and the baby wasn't breathing. He's handled 3 SIDS deaths and it
      broke his heart. His boy was 2 weeks old at the time and he picked up the
      baby and got him breathing. All the internal affairs complaints, all the
      garbage that's going on now, the public attitude toward police, the stuff
      that is really negative towards police and about the job that overweighed

      Philadelphia, PA 3</b>   (11:04 PM Street Patrol) Capt Benjamin Braxton is
      inspecting the cops at HQ and says to make sure they keep the road open,
      nobody stop, no rear enders, doesn’t want them to get hurt, doesn’t
      have to tell them how to do their jobs or they wouldn’t be there. Patrol
      Officer Hank Glenn and Patrol Officer King Harris listen. (Highway Patrol)
      King says he’s been there 20 years, 90% of the time in high crime areas.
      They go on a lot of felony calls – robberies, shootings, burglaries and
      rapes. Any time they go with a report of a gun and do not know if the
      suspect is still on scene, mentally they have to be prepared, have to make
      it a safe situation. Any call could be a gun battle or a tussle.
      (Communication Center) A 9 year old boy calls in that his father is
      stopping a burglar, but doesn’t know his address. The father comes back
      and says he shot the guy in his barbershop. They drive over to 1626, pass
      right by and go in reverse. They jump out into North Philly Cuts &amp;
      Fades and when they get inside they hear shots. A man yells, “Get out of
      my face you bitch!” They tell him to come out. The guy keeps saying, “I
      said!” as there are sounds of a struggle. He yells “kill me!” again
      and again. He’s at the top of the steps in the back where the man lives
      and is naked. They yell to put the gun down and come out, but have to go
      up and get him. The guy says, “I’m through, put it in the paper!’
      again and again. He struggles, tries to bite them and they can’t hold
      him down because he’s too slippery from sweat and blood. He gets up and
      almost gets out the door by running and crawling. They hit him with a
      metal chair, pull him down and lose their cuffs. They go to cuff him again
      and Sgt. Raymond Convery calls for a wagon. He’s shot in the arm and
      spurting blood all over. The two guys were shooting at each other
      upstairs. If they shot at the cops they would’ve shot back,
      unfortunately the victim might’ve gotten shot. The naked guy is the
      burglar, the victim owns the barbershop and lives above it. He doesn’t
      know the suspect. He fired at him. He’s all wet and bloody, nothing to
      hold on to, they don’t know what’s in his blood, don’t want it on
      them, but have to get it on you to lock him up. (5:43 PM Assistance Call)
      25th District - Officer Christine Couter says it was a nice neighborhood a
      long time ago, before the drugs. Now with the drugs there it’s gotten
      bad, they’ll steal anything to get money to get high, like TV’s for
      $2. So many people there who have nothing, no license, no ID and cars that
      are wrecked. Some people are good, just stuck there. You can’t find out
      who they are, it’s overwhelming and can’t take them to jail just to
      find out who they are. Officer Luis Colon says the Sgt. called to look for
      a blue Monte Carlo. They spot the car down the road, go to cut him off and
      he crashes right into their police car. The guy is totally high, says he
      isn’t and they know him. The front of his car is totally wrecked from
      crashing into other cars. He knows Luis and calls him by name. The victim
      says he jumped in his car and took off. He has to fill out paperwork
      before he can get it back. He hit 2-3 cars and has lots of front end
      damage. He says that’s why he has insurance. He is Middle Eastern, doesn’t
      know the guy, it was a few blocks away where it happened. He left his keys
      in the car and went in a store. The guy just took it, couldn’t drive
      because he was impaired. The Sgt. knew he couldn’t drive, but didn’t
      know it was stolen. The suspect doesn’t even know his own name. They
      take him to the station. Sgt. Victor Ramirez says he came wrong way down a
      one way with people chasing him, yelling at him to stop. He saw him crash
      head on into a vehicle at a stop sign. They asked him why he was out of it
      and he said he did 3 bags of Angel Dust. They put him in the wagon and his
      pants are falling down. (9:17 PM) 4th District - Officer Daniel O’Brien
      says it’s a high narcotics area, so he looks for drug deals and stolen
      cars. It’s the first of the month, social security checks are in, so he’s
      also looking for strong arm robberies. Officer Michael Gormley says a girl
      looks like she’s dong a deal. An undercover says she went in to buy
      drugs and they are waiting for her to come out. They spot two car thieves
      in 2 separate cars and follow them to see what they are up to. One is a
      yellow Toyota. They lose one, think he went west on Shrieve to get the
      girl. The other car has a passenger and goes south on 3rd. Two of the
      police cars are undercover. Joe is at Fourth and Rutner. The car goes into
      the gas station on Front. A bus stops and they hide behind him at
      Gagliardi’s. Dan gets out of the car, walks to the bus, light a
      cigarette and tells them he’s moving north on front. They filled up,
      snuck out the back and picked up another guy. They follow them as they
      stop and break into a car on 3rd and McKean. Dan gets out and takes one
      guy down. Mike helps him cuff Joe on the street. Joe says he didn’t
      break into no car and repeats it 3 more times. The other unit spots a car
      just like it on 2nd. He popped the window and was trying to pop the
      steering column with a screwdriver when he caught him. A wagon arrives and
      they put him. He stole numerous cars and will be spending July 4th behind
      bars. <b>Note:</b> rumor has it the man in the barbershop was a premed
      college student with no criminal history. Someone slipped PCP into his
      food, he was trying to get help and he went crazy. On the way to the
      station his heart exploded and he died. #521. 8/15/92</td>

      Rick Benson says when you get into something you get a 2-3 minute
      adrenaline rush and when it's over, you want to do it again to get the
      rush. It makes you feel good. When cops pulled up to the house the guy
      fled in a white Ford pickup. He turns his lights out so a helicopter
      lights him up. A bunch of cars get behind him and he pulls over, runs and
      is caught. Now it's a felony. He wants to talk to his brother, but they
      say he doesn't run the show. He went around the house and was trying all
      the windows and doors to get in. There is a 3/4 empty 12 pack in his
      truck. (1:48 AM Officer Assistance) Rick takes off and comes up on Officer
      Dale McCoy fighting with a drunk Mexican. Rick helps by throwing him face
      first on the ground and he leaves a bloody spot. Dale says the guy was
      fighting with a 60 year old in the bar and he knocked his glasses off and
      5 friends came out and joined him. Rick says not all calls go the way they
      want and they know people want to hurt them. When you call for help on the
      radio and even if the cops don't like you, they will show up to help and
      give you a chance to recover. Officer J.R. Jacoby goes to a call on
      Diamond Hill. Officer Maurine Harkrider joins him. North Sector - they go
      up to the house with a witness and she has cat, guesses there is no dog.
      Maurine goes to the door and the guy has a gun so she draws on him and
      yells to drop it. They pull him out and cuff him on the lawn. He only
      speaks Spanish and keeps saying why over and over and that someone wants
      to kill him. The daughter speaks English and says last night the police
      came and took his gun away, but he went out and bought another. Sgt. David
      Carroll talks to her. She says he shot the gun in the yard. J.R. finds a
      dozen empty shells in the yard. The girl says he gets mad and drinks.
      Maurine says she saw him on the couch and pulled the guy out. J.R. finds a
      puppy in the yard that the man wanted to kill because he was mad. The guy
      lives there and isn't married to her mom. J.R. says to put all his stuff
      in a garbage bag and get him out. The guy is drunk, confused, angry,
      loading the gun in front of the kids and telling them he's going to kill
      their dog. Officer Bill Daniels and Officer Bob Abbott are driving. Bill
      likes this area because his last area didn't have enough adrenaline
      rushes. There is more chases here to get you pumping. (11:52 PM Burglary
      in Progress) A loan company called thinking they hear voices in their
      building. They drive up, but have trouble finding the place in the dark.
      Other cops and a helicopter arrive and they pour out searching the ground.
      A K-9 finds one black man in the back. He says he &quot;ain't did
      nothing&quot;, he's just there minding his own business and wants to know
      what's going on. He is 33, cuffed and led away. They go inside with the
      dog looking for others. The door is open and there is a microwave by the
      door. There is a bag outside the window filled with stolen items. The
      kitchen is a total mess. The owner arrives and says it's the 4th time the
      place has been robbed in the last year. He is so happy they actually
      caught the guy and got all the stuff. Usually he shows up and everything
      is gone. Bill says it's really strange that the guy was only stealing
      food, snacks, soda and change from the soda machine. #535. 5/15/93</td>

      little farm town in central IL. They didn't even have a stop light. He's
      been there 6 years and nothing could prepare him for working on the
      streets. The call is that the guy is supposed to have a rifle. He gets out
      and there is a bunch of black guys who say the man ran away while there
      are two guys shot on the ground. He drives off with another unit to where
      they said the guy went. They pull the guy out off his house. Officer Steve
      Benjamin mirandizes him. He says he stashed the gun at Walker street. The
      2 guys jumped him with pistols and he shot them. He's been shot before and
      lifts his shirt to show a bullet wound and a huge amount of cut and stitch
      marks. He lost a kidney and doesn't want to get shot anymore. They were
      selling dope in front of his mother's house and he was tired of it so he
      shot them. He stops before they get back to the crime scene where things
      are heating up and they don't want to bring the guy. They find two rifles
      in the bushes including a large Marlin 30-30. They have lots of heated
      arguments in the area that used to be fist fights, now they grab guns and
      aren't afraid. (9:45 PM Suspicious Activity Call) West Sector - Officer
      Don Hanlon goes by a cleaners and the door is open and there are no lights
      inside, it's probably a robbery. Sgt. Tim Ellis joins him and they go up
      to the door. Don throws his lit flashlight inside and nothing happens. It
      is very crowded and hard to search. They get to the front and find
      nothing, but the front door is locked. Out back a witness says he saw 2
      guys hiding behind a dumpster. They go to talk to them and they run.
      Eventually they catch two white guys who claim they were just watching the
      thieves. Don asks them why they ran, they say because they didn't know
      what they would do to them. The witness says he saw them loading stuff
      into a white car by the 7-11. One kid says he was driving his friend home
      and they saw the police and wanted to see what was going on. It doesn't
      explain why they ran. The owner arrives and says it has been broken into
      many times before. It turns out the kids story was true, but they were
      stupid and will get resisting arrest. (11:34 PM Assault Call) Officer Bob
      Abbott doesn't do it for the money, he likes doing it. You have to like
      doing it to work graveyard. Some people dread going to work and he doesn't
      understand it, he loves his job.&nbsp; A man was beating on his girlfriend
      when cops arrived. He goes to back them up. The guy ran off into a field
      and a helicopter is looking for him. He can hear noises and a barking dog.
