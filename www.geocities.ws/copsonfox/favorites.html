<p align="left">Because I am one of the few people who has seen every episode of
the show I am often asked what my favorite episodes are. This is a complicated
question for many reasons. First - every few years Cops tells us what the best
ones are first with 2 half hour shows at the end of Season 3 - Best of Cops 1&amp;2,
then 3-7 at the end of Season 7, five more at the end of Season 8, four more at
the end of Season 13, plus a 2 hour Greatest Moments special, three more at the
end of Season 14, then two big 2 hour specials at the end of Season 16 and
finally the 1 hour 20th anniversary special. They also released many of the
segments onto home video and DVD compilations and they are most of the good ones
that I agree with. Second with over 750 episodes we are talking over 2250
segments to choose from which is daunting. Third unlike other shows there aren't
any bad seasons or shows where you could say 'oh well that was when the show
went really downhill' to eliminate. Finally that leaves everything else for me
to choose from instead of just rehashing those best of shows. These are ones that
should've been included as best ones, but weren't. </p>

 1020 - Kansas City, MO - Hot water heater in hot water - Officer Tony White
 &amp; Officer Jason Crump come upon a black man in a mask wheeling a cart down
 the road with a hot water heater inside at 2:30am. It still has the water pipes
 attached to it which have been sawed through and the steam is still coming off
 the water pouring out. There is a water trail from that spot right to the spot
 in the building where the heater was attached, but he claims at 2am someone
 just threw it out like that and he went and got his cart and scooped it up. He
 says he has no way to cut it, but is loaded with tools to do it. No matter how
 much evidence is stacked against him he thinks that repeating the same lies enough
 that they will buy it.
