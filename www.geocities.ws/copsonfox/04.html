    <td width="810" height="1"><b>Boston, MA 1</b> (11:16 PM Drug Sweeps) Area A-7 -
      Officer Mike Lopriore says Boston is just the right size, was a good place
      to grow up - not too big or too small, neighborhoods are sectioned off,
      good city, it's run well, nothing else he could ask for. He loves it and
      there's nothing else he'd rather be doing than policing the city he grew
      up in. He spots a drug deal in an alley as they drive by. He gets out and
      sneaks around back. He catches a white guy in a blue jacket and presses
      him against a fence. His partner Officer Peter Fontanez catches the other
      guy and brings him over. The guy starts choking and Mike pounds him on the
      back until he spits out 3 bags of cocaine. They call him an idiot. Peter
      cut them off with the car and enabled Mike to catch them. After he says
      lots of guys choke on the bags and they have to play paramedic. They bring
      the kid to the station and the kid says he wasn't doing anything.
      (11:56PM) He's charged with possession class B and possession within 1000
      feet of a school, then he is mirandized. He says he has 2 kids and was
      going to rehab Tuesday, then counseling. Mike says he could've choked to
      death. (4:06 PM Roll Call) with Officer Robert Anthony. He takes the call
      of a woman trying to pass a phony prescription at a supermarket. Officer
      Ralph Amoroso questions her and she says she was picking it up for a
      neighbor Donna. The pharmacist says she's called before, but the
      information she gave didn't match up. She wanted Vicadin and gives Ralph
      her ID and the pharmacist calls the doctor. The woman claims she didn't
      know it was phony and wants to know if she is under arrest and can she
      leave. She's an attorney. They say they can detain her until they
      determine if there was a crime, the Sgt is on the way. Robert asks to see
      her Bar Card if she's a lawyer, but she doesn't have one. Sgt. Francis
      Gaughan talks to the pharmacist who says she couldn't find the name and
      stalled until police arrived. She said it was for Navarro. The woman says
      she has 2 kids in her car, but there is no one there. She is arrested for
      a 92C - passing a phony prescription. Francis says they have to cuff, it's
      the law. They check her car and find 3 additional license plates in the
      car. They also find prescription bags with no receipts and different
      names. The pharmacist comes out and checks the bags and says it's a highly
      addictive pill and sells for about $8 a pill. Cops say she is the best
      scammer they've ever seen. Sgt. Joe Flandaca has a Warrant Briefing. A
      couple has a 22 year old son and they have a sledgehammer to break the
      door down if necessary. They arrive at 4:22 pm. They get in and have to go
      up and downstairs to check the place. Detective Chuck Wilson questions the
      old man, Johnny, who owns the house if there is any cocaine there.
      Detective Joe Mugnano says his son will get locked up if they find any
      coke and it isn't his fault. The old guy&nbsp; understands. Joe says he
      has a chance of saving everyone else from being charged if he'll tell them
      the truth. Mike Lopriore says the guy told him where everything is, but
      doesn't believe it. He's arrested the son 5 times for drugs already - it
      runs in the family. They find bags of rocks in the Cheerios cereal. A call
      comes in from Tony who wants to bet on the Celtics and Joe pretends he's
      Johnny and takes the call making up a point spread. The phone rings again
      and he says that Johnny is out for a while and he's taking care of things.
      He takes a bet over the phone. Cops keep tearing up the place looking for
      drugs, in dresses in a closet, in the couch and they find nunchucks. They
      cuff him and Joe says they have a steady gambling habit and sell the drugs
      to pay the gambling bills. (8:12PM) Chuck helps Johnny into the back of
      his car and he can barely get in because he's 70 years old. #415. 11/16/91</td>

      Area D Briefing - The Sgt. talks to Officer John Ridge &amp; Officer Bill
      Reynolds about liability. He's mentioned it before that if you have a
      situation where you make an arrest and you can make or not make a report -
      always makes a report - liability, liability, liability. Then he wants to
      know if anyone has a joke, but no one does. A call comes in of a fire on
      Angeline Rd where a man jumped from the building and hit the ground. A
      crowd is gathering as they get stuck in traffic on the way. There is a
      white man in his underwear on the ground with both feet and arms broken
      and bloody and they tell him to relax. The fire department shows up and
      says the fire is in Apt 204 where the man jumped from. Everyone else is
      out of the all elderly building. The man says his hands and feet hurt as
      they put a brace on his neck and he yells not to touch his feet. He jumped
      from the window, to the roof then to the street. The man fought with his
      wife, ran down the hall, ran into another apartment and fought with the
      woman there. She ran out and he stayed inside and set the place on fire
      and jumped. (5:37 PM 911 Call) PD Headquarters Communications Center - a
      man calls from the Angelo Seafood Restaurant about a guy creating a
      disturbance. (5:42 PM Disturbance Call) Officer Brian McMasters &amp;
      Officer Ralph Amoroso go to the call saying it's a law going back to the
      1700s about disturbing the innkeeper. Angelo and his wife says the guy has
      complained to them three times. He ate 3/4 of the clams in a box and then
      wanted a refund. The customer says they have the best fish in town, but
      the clams are tough, taste terrible and you can't chew them. Ralph says
      they can't give him a refund since he ate most of it. The guy says he's
      going to picket outside tomorrow. He used to come in once a week to eat
      the clams, but they did this to him out of spite. He'll have to go to
      another seafood restaurant now. (9:17 PM Domestic Violence Call) They go
      and talk to a 72 year old woman who won't put up with the abuse any more.
      The drunk guy needs help, is overweight, he's abused her and she’s
      scared for her life. Backup arrives and all five of them go upstairs to
      get Michael. They find him in the apartment and he wants his shoes and
      says not to push him. They’ve been there a few times for him. Back at
      the station they tell him his wife is scared and wants him to get help. He
      says she’s his wife, people think she's his mother. Help won't help him,
      he went to AA and all they talk about is booze. He wants to forget booze.
      They have to move the table so he can get out since he is so fat. They
      uncuff him and tell him to behave or he'll go in a cell. Mike kisses their
      hands, cries and doesn't want to go to jail. He has a hearing aid and they
      make him take his jewelry off, but his finger is red and swollen under his
      ring. He says last night he dreamt he was a police officer. (7:12 PM Roll
      Call) Officer John Ridge says the police have been in his family for over
      30 years, he was born and raised with it, his cousins, uncles and father
      were cops. You can't explain the job to people, it's too complicated going
      from one call to the next. (10:10 Disturbance Call) It’s at the Food
      Basket convenience store. When they get there the guy takes off and they
      chase him. When they catch him he says he wasn't doing anything, just
      talking to a guy. Then he says he was running to catch a train. They put
      him in a car and the victim arrives. He says he took money out of a MAC
      machine and asked for a quarter, then a dollar, then $10 dollars. He
      followed him into the store and took a swing at him. It was a vicious shot
      that knocked off his glasses. They pull the guy out of the car and cuff
      him. He starts getting loud and violent saying he just came out of a house
      right now, he didn't rob anyone. He says they are doing this because he's
      Puerto Rican and they are white. The victim says he hit him in the store,
      they went outside to talk and the guy hit him again and broke his glasses.
      The guy screams that he will kill him and the guy is a liar. John says
      usually they don't catch the guy because they flee, but this time they got
      him and he's going to jail. #417. 11/23/91</td>

      East Boston - Officer Robert Anthony listens as the detective talks about
      a house dealing coke out of it. They’ll take a sledgehammer if needed
      and there is a woman there. They all load up and enter the apartment
      building, run down the hallway and knock and enter. There are two people
      downstairs, and three upstairs. On 11/7 they sold to an undercover cop so
      they know they have drugs. If Donald cooperates only he and his wife will
      go down, not everyone. Detective Joe Mugnano makes a drug deal on the
      phone with the delivery guy saying the woman is in the bathroom. He tells
      them to come up and ring the bell twice. The guy comes up with the coke
      and they jump him. They pull him in fast and get bags of rocks off him.
      They put the owners in cuffs and lead them out. (10:27 PM) At the station
      they talk about beeping a Spanish drug dealer to see if he'll show up.
      They drive down to because he's supposed to have an ounce of coke. The
      dealer is driving right at them and they cut him off. They pull him out,
      check his mouth for drugs and find wads of money on him. They don't want
      to tie up the street so they bring him back to the station to thoroughly
      check the car. (11:42 PM) They tear the car up at the station and find
      bags of rocks in the dash. (9:10 PM Investigation Call) Officer Bill
      Reynolds and his partner Officer John Ridge are heading to the 560 block.
      Jackie is on a blind date and called her father screaming. They are
      supposed to be in apartment 1208 and they check with security at the
      building and run up there. They knock and no one answers. They go back
      down to security to get there parking space number. They check it and the
      car is gone. They are in a black Saab and spot them on the road and chase
      them down. They pull them out and the woman is shaken, she has no idea
      what is going on. She says everything is fine, it must be a joke and
      they've only been out 2 hours. Bill tells her to call her dad. Jackie
      calls her brother Joe to ask what's going on. It turns out she said she
      was having an emergency, but all she needed was hair gel and that they are
      weird. John talks to the brother on the phone. She was getting ready and
      left a message on her sisters machine that it was an emergency. The sister
      called the father who called them. It's a date she'll never forget. (9:02
      PM Disturbance Call) Officer Edward Tansey says Lynn is a beautiful city,
      has the biggest reservation and is right outside of Boston. Officer
      Charles Griffin is his partner. They are going to a house where a Tammy
      threatened to set her house on fire. They've been there before, it's off
      the road. They go in and a woman says it's a drug deal gone bad. She gave
      him $40 and they ripped her off. There are three men - two Dominicans and
      a Puerto Rico inside man who don’t speak English. One of them has a
      large knife. They say Jose is the dealer and isn't there. Tammy has bought
      from him before, but says she's Vanessa. He's there illegally and she is
      mad because last night they bought from him and it was baking soda so she
      called the police. Sgt. Robert O'Neil talks to the girlfriend of the
      manager Bob McDenna who says the three guys don't belong there. The renter
      was evicted yesterday and the place is supposed to be empty. The woman was
      assaulted trying to buy coke. They put the money under the door for coke,
      but got nothing back. She says she smokes, not snorts and only spends $40
      a day so it’s not a bad habit. #420. 12/14/91</td>
