      Disturbance Call) Rialto PD - Officer Joe Maltese says a neighbor spotted
      several males fighting and the men appear to be heavily armed. Joe spots several men 
      walking away from the area of the
      disturbance and orders them to the ground at gunpoint. One of the men
      protests that he was going home and doesn’t know what is happening, but
      a pat down reveals a sawed-off shotgun down his pants leg – exactly what
      a witness stated they saw. The suspect, a minor, is taken to the station
      where his stunned parents question him. His father is frustrated and
      disappointed in his son’s actions but tells him they will get through
      this together. Deputy Thomas Gunter of the Brevard Co FL Sheriff’s
      Office patrols an area known for drug activity and spots a 'hand to hand'
      transaction in progress. The deputy spots a male pushing a bicycle away
      and makes contact. The male suspect quickly admits that he is busted and opens his hand
       to reveal a quantity of crack cocaine.
      The suspect is taken into custody for possession and complains that the
      deputy is picking on him and that he was set up. The suspect tells the
      deputy that several men flagged him down and he 'succumbed' to pressure to
      buy the drugs. He refuses to believe that he has not been a victim of a
      sting operation, although the deputies tell him that this arrest was not
      part of sting. The suspect tells the deputies that he was lured into
      purchasing the drugs and that he is not a drug user and only has a passing
      interest in crack cocaine. The drugs are tested and come back positive and
      the man is arrested for the felony. Deputy Jennifer Torres of the Lee County
      FL Sheriff’s Office is dispatched to a verbal/physical fight at a
      local motel. A female with visible injuries explains that her boyfriend
      became jealous when she sang karaoke with another man at a birthday party
      earlier in the evening. When she tried to hug her boyfriend, he pushed her
      to the ground. She claims she ripped a necklace off of his neck but
      otherwise did not touch him. The boyfriend tells Deputy Torres that they
      had both been drinking earlier and she got angry with him and would not
      back down forcing him to flee the residence to avoid any further
      escalation of violence. Witnesses indicate that the woman was the
      aggressor and the deputies arrest the female. She is astonished that she
      is going to be arrested when she has injuries. The woman becomes more
      irate and yells at the deputies that she should not be arrested because of
      her obvious injury. The male ‘victim’ professes his love for his
      girlfriend and asks why she has to be ‘so mean’. #2001. 9/15/07</td>

      PM Deputy Assistance Call) Sheriff’s Office East Precinct - FTO Jason
      Drinkwater responds to backup a deputy on a disturbance call. En route,
      the deputy learns that a male suspect is fighting with the deputies on
      scene. When they arrive, the male suspect makes a break for it and a foot
      chase ensues. Shortly after it starts, the deputies catch the man and take
      him into custody. One of the deputies on scene tells the man that
      ironically he was about to be let go before he decided to run. The man
      claims that he ran so he could say goodbye to his wife, who was being
      arrested for outstanding warrants. The arresting deputy also found a pill
      bottle and a bag containing a straw with drug residue. The female tells
      the deputy that the couple has been having issues due to his father dying
      recently and the male’s mentally retarded mother. The male suspect is
      interviewed by FTO Drinkwater and tells him that he had no intention of
      resisting arrest. Drinkwater explains the suspect’s charges and allows
      the couple to say goodbye to each other. Deputy Chris Nebel of the Lee County
      FL Sheriff’s Office patrols an area of North District and spots a golf
      cart being driven by a young man. The golf cart is on a public road with
      no lights on. The young man explains that he was trying to get home and
      just received the cart from his friend. The young man is on probation for
      grand theft (of a go kart) and has a curfew, which he is breaking by being
      out after midnight. The young man pleads with the deputy to let him go
      home as he has school tomorrow. While the man attempts to receive
      favorable treatment from the deputy, his record comes back showing several
      arrests in the past year for burglary and battery. The young man’s
      mother shows up and tells the deputy a different story – that her son
      traded a bike for the golf cart today, not 4 months ago as he had stated.
      The irate mother yells at her son and tells him she isn’t going to deal
      with him right now as she has her own problems to deal with. The deputy
      takes the young man down to the detention center for breaking curfew and
      the golf cart is impounded. Officer Robert Morales of the Rialto, CA
      Police Department responds to an assault with a deadly weapon call that
      took place at a convenience store. Another officer has pulled over a
      vehicle matching the description of the ‘getaway’ truck. The officers
      remove the occupants during the felony traffic stop. Officer Morales
      questions one of the occupants of the vehicle about what transpired at the
      store. The man claims it was just a ‘beer run’ gone wrong. Several of
      the clerks at the store attempted to stop the young men from stealing the
      beer and the men attacked them with a bat and golf club in front of the
      store. The surveillance video is viewed by the officers that collaborates
      the story told by the clerks. One of the young men’s mothers comes to
      the station and tearfully confronts her son about the assault. #2002.

      deputies that if he had a gun he could have easily shot them during the
      hunt. Deputies find a meth pipe in the man’s sock during the arrest. The

      ex-wife invited him over so that she could have him arrested. Las Vegas,

      Burglary Call) Pomona PD - Corporal Darryll Johnson investigates a
      possible burglary in progress. He arrives at the small taco stand and sees
      a broken service window. After spotting damage to a cash register in the
      back, he radios for a K-9 unit. The dog is put through the window to
      determine if anyone is still in the business. Almost immediately the dog
      finds the suspect and the suspect begins screaming. Several officers crawl
      through the window and take the man into custody. The suspect claims his
      friend works at the eatery and locked him in to go get beer. Further
      investigation determines that the name of the person that supposedly
      worked at the taco stand is not an employee. Officers survey the damage
      and discuss the K-9’s engagement with the suspect. Deputy Andrew
      Porcelli of the Martin County FL Sheriff’s Office conducts a traffic stop a
      vehicle with a brake light out. The driver admits he doesn’t have a
      license and is detained. The driver also admits that he has prescription
      pills in the glove box. The female passenger is 8 months pregnant and is
      complaining of leg pain. Because the woman needs medical care, she is
      allowed to contact someone for a ride to the hospital. She admits that she
      has been arrested in the past for possession of paraphernalia. Deputy
      Porcelli finds the pill bottle – with no label. The driver claims the
      label has just ‘worn off’. He finds more pills and a hypodermic needle
      in the glove box. The driver claims that he doesn’t eat the pills and
      crushes the pills and snorts them. Deputy Porcelli also learns the man was
      arrested three days prior for having illegal prescription pills. The
      pregnant passenger is allowed to take the vehicle so that she can get
      medical attention. The deputies admonish the pregnant female for her
      involvement in drugs and hopes that she gets help before she gives birth.
      Sgt. Steven Strivelli and Sgt. Anthony Torella of the Palm Beach County FL
      Sheriff’s Office Vice Unit raid a suspected drug house, arresting
      several people in the home. The female homeowner is upset to learn that
      the woman she had tried to help out is selling crack out of her house and
      angrily tells her to leave. The deputies learn that the dealer is ‘dry’,
      meaning they are expecting more drugs to be coming to the house for sells.
      The deputies take over the house and wait until the couriers arrive with
      more drugs. Soon, two women and a young child arrive with a large amount
      of drugs in their possession. One of the women claims to not have any
      knowledge of the drugs and tells deputies she has no drug history. She
      then changes her story and tells the deputies she has been arrested for
      drugs in the past. The deputies admonish the mother for bringing her kid
      to the drug transaction and she will be charged with child abuse as well.
      Another courier arrives with more drugs and they too are arrested for
      possession with intent to distribute. #2033. 7/19/08</td>

      exchange for forty dollars worth of crack cocaine. She later adds that she
      is a prostitute and decided to prolong the use of her vehicle for services
      rendered. The owner shows up and admits he knows the woman and details the
