<p align="left">I started watching and recording the show since it first
started. Then right before Season 16 started I wanted to rerecord all my old
episodes to upgrade to a higher quality when they reaired. What I found out were
that certain episodes are never shown, 2 have been changed, an hour episode was
only reshown as a half hour, one had 2 segments removed and the third recycled on
another episode. Later there was even an episode announced that was never shown,
but to this day is still listed in the reruns and is always something else.
There has never been an official statement about banning an episode, so I went
back and watched all of them and the underlying thing I found was all of them
had extremely bloody segments and murders. </p>

      the soap opera bits that Fox forced him to add so in reruns they broke the
      episode into 2 parts which means credits and theme song in the middle, so
      5 minutes were edited out - The fire/Nick at home, Homicide intro, Ron's
      wife's big discussion about communication &amp; some of the end news. A
      new interview segment of Vicki was added at the end making 2 versions with
      exclusive footage.
