<p>Cops camera crews are looking for them bad boys<br>
by Stacey Mulick | News Tribune&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, camera crews from the television show Cops are riding
around with Pierce County sheriff's deputies. The ride-alongs begin tonight,
sheriff's spokesman Ed Troyer said. Camera crews will be riding with deputies
patrolling South Hill and East Pierce County. The crews will be in tow for the
next four to six weeks. They'll be filming police incidents for the upcoming
season of Cops . Troyer said the Pierce County episodes will be featured along
with incidents from other law enforcement agencies throughout the country.
&quot;You will see us,&quot; he said. &quot;There is never a shortage of
material when they come here.&quot;</p>

<p>There are a few green patrol cars left but most are now white. Also all
deputies went to dark blue uniforms. The Lakewood Police Department became their
own department in late 2004. They are not contracted by the Pierce county
sheriffs department anymore and the chief said Cops could not film with them anymore because
&quot;it made the city look bad&quot;. Louie&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Las&nbsp; Vegas - When the 21st season of the reality show Cops
premieres this fall, all 36 episodes will be shot using Sony’s XDCAM HD
Professional Disc System. Cops post production supervisor Mitsuo Goto said he
recommended the XDCAM system to Langley Productions, the creator and producer of
Cops as an efficient, cost-effective way to transition from its current
tape-based infrastructure to an all file-based work flow – saving money and
time throughout the production process. Langley Productions purchased 13 XDCAM
HD units for the Cops production team. “The camera has tremendous depth of
field and produces phenomenal images in low-light situations, which is the most
common shooting scenario for this series,” Goto said. “This is critical
since the crew is frequently running after bad guys. We needed a camera that
could absorb a lot of shock, and this one was definitely up to the job.”</p>

Ex-detective gets 3 years for sexual battery. Judge wanted longer sentence, but
case was hard to prosecute<br>
By Paul Pinkham, The Times-Union<br>
His disgrace complete, former Jacksonville narcotics detective <b> Shawn Mario
Pringle</b> (episode #1302) was sentenced to prison Friday, four years after three women accused him
of using his badge to force sex. Pringle, 38, received three years, the maximum under his plea agreement with
prosecutors. Circuit Judge Mallory Cooper indicated she wanted to go higher, but
she noted the legal difficulties prosecutors had with the case. Pringle had faced two counts of sexual battery and one count each of
attempted sexual battery, misuse of a public office and petit theft. He pleaded
guilty in December to one count of sexual battery and misusing his office by
forcing a drug informant to have sex with him by threatening her with prison
time and the loss of her children. Two other women told detectives Pringle used his police blue lights to pull
them over and assault them in 2000 and 2002, and prosecutors identified four
additional victims in court. &quot;You were a person in power with a gun, and because of that, this is so
much more egregious,&quot; Cooper told Pringle. &quot;There is no way to
quantify the damage to the Sheriff's Office by this behavior and ... to the
victim.&quot; Cooper added three years of sex offender probation to the prison time,
meaning Pringle must register as a sex offender and undergo psychosexual
counseling and monitoring. None of the victims were in court. Pringle read a brief statement to Cooper, accepting responsibility for his
actions. He has been free on $250,000 bail and living under house arrest since
2004.</p>

<p>On Sunday, February 24, John Langley presented a $10,000 check from Twentieth
Century Fox Home Entertainment (TCFHE) toward the capital campaign for the
National Law Enforcement Museum, an architecturally inspiring, world-class
museum scheduled to open in Washington, DC, in 2011. The donation was accepted
by Museum representative John Shanks immediately prior to the Auto Club 500
NASCAR race at the California Speedway in Fontana, CA. To commemorate the
release of the COPS 20th Anniversary Edition DVD, Fox Home Entertainment asked
Mr. Langley to select a charitable cause to which TCFHE could make a
contribution. &quot;John Langley has been an influential and passionate
supporter of law enforcement for years,&quot; said Craig Floyd, chairman and CEO
of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, which is leading the
effort to build the National Law Enforcement Museum. &quot;Not only has the
'COPS' program provided Americans with a first-hand look at the challenges and
dangers that our men and women in blue face every day, but John has personally
donated to our Museum project as well. We are very pleased that Fox Home
Entertainment is honoring John's work on behalf of law enforcement with this
generous donation,&quot; Mr. Floyd added. Authorized by Congress in the year
2000, the planned National Law Enforcement Museum is a 95,000 square foot,
mostly underground museum to be located just blocks from the U.S. Capitol and
adjacent to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. When it opens in
2011, the Museum will provide an estimated 600,000 visitors a year with a unique
and comprehensive look at the law enforcement profession. The Museum will
feature high-tech, interactive exhibitions, interesting historical and
contemporary artifacts, and extensive educational programming. Groundbreaking is
scheduled for later in 2008. The privately funded Museum has launched an $80
million capital campaign, with approximately $33 million raised to date. For

tour, visit <a href="http://www.lawenforcementmuseum.org/">www.LawEnforcementMuseum.org</a></p>

job for 5 years and is responsible for the apprehension of hundreds of violent
felons during his career. Sgt. Dennis Joy and Leo were working their last
scheduled shift together on November 16th before Leo's retirement when Leo began
behaving strangely. Sgt. Joy took Leo to a vet where he was diagnosed with
cancer. Tumors had burst in his spleen and invaded his blood stream. While Leo
could have survived for a few months, he would have been in constant pain. With
every member of the K9 Unit present, Leo was euthanized at 1:00am on November
17th. The Sacramento Police Canine Association, a non-profit organization which
provides for the care of retired Sacramento Police K-9's, handled the funeral

Cops Production crews had hoped to begin filming the Austin, TX officers in May, but city
officials reconsidered, saying the show generally depicted only the more
sensational aspects of a police officer's work, the
American-Statesman reported Wednesday. Assistant City Manager Michael McDonald
said he feared viewers might not see, for example, how officers do community
policing or talk with neighborhood residents while on patrol.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spokane, WA - At 1:36 pm,&nbsp; 9/7/07 Spokane Police Officer Michael McNab spotted a
stolen 2004 Dodge Ram pick-up parked on the street at Myrtle/Wellesley. The
pick-up had been stolen this morning at 10:26 a.m. from 222 E. Lyons. The keys
were in the truck when it was stolen. The owner was a short distance away
unloading items from the truck for a food drive.&nbsp; The suspect was outside the stolen truck. He hopped back in and fled,
speeding away Northbound on Market. Several other Spokane Police officers joined
the pursuit as it went at speeds of up to 70 MPH into the Northeast part of
Spokane and then into Spokane County. The suspect drove into the North-South
Freeway construction area in an attempt to lose the officers. He then drove up
hills, through brush, and around trees and ended up in the area of Argonne/Stoneman.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The suspect then fled South from there and ended up going South from Bigelow
Gulch Road/Weile to the area of 5600 N Theirman where he went into the fields.
There the suspect stalled his vehicle, at which time Officer McNab ran up to the
stolen vehicle and tried to remove the suspect from the truck. Officer McNab was
drug a short distance by the suspect while he was outside of the vehicle. McNab
was not hurt. When Officer McNab went to return to his patrol car, he found it on fire
underneath the driver’s side. He used his fire extinguisher in an attempt to
put out the fire, but was not successful. Spokane Valley Fire Department
responded, but the 2002 Ford Crown Victoria was totally engulfed by the time
they got there. The car is a total loss.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spokane Police, Spokane Valley Police, and Spokane County Sheriff Deputies
surrounded the area looking for the suspect and the stolen vehicle. At 2:53
p.m., a Citizen telephoned 911 stating he saw the suspect walking the bank of
the Spokane River near Boulder Beach. Officers responded to that location and
located Brian E. Gorder, 05-02-1978, a City of Spokane resident, hiding in brush and rocks. He
was taken into custody without incident. Witnesses were transported to this
location and positively identified Gorder as the suspect wanted by police. Gorder was booked into the Spokane County Jail for 1st Degree Theft, a
felony, and Attempting to Elude a Police Officer, also a felony.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a great example of citizens and police working together. Had it not
been for the citizen calling 911, Mr. Gorder may have eluded police and the
owner of the truck could have lost his vehicle altogether. Police also had
citizens willing to look for the suspect in the area of Argonne/Bigelow Gulch
Road. Their help is much appreciated.</p>

<p>Veteran sound mixer, Steven Douglas Malito (born 8/21/55), died August 5th,
2006, in Las Vegas while working on Cops there.<br>
He had failed to show up for work at the sub station he and his local camera guy
were working out of. The sound guy called one of the associate producers who
then went to Steve's hotel room. It was locked from the inside and because of
that, the hotel would not break in. The producer then called the police, who
came and entered the room. Steve was in bed. He had died about 23 hours prior to
the discovery and an autopsy disclosed cause of death was from a blocked artery.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steve had worked for the show about 15 years and was
responsible for the sound of some of the greatest episodes the show had aired.
He was a super great guy and we all loved him very much. He lived in Houston
with his wife and children. A funeral will be held Wed and a fund is being set
up for his family. All I can say is that it's a terrible loss of a friend and
colleague. - Rob Whitehurst<center><b><br>

<p>Man Whose Arrest Was Filmed By 'Cops' Sues Officers For Brutality (This was
in Resisting Arrest 4 #1718)<br>
By KOMO Staff &amp; News Services&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seattle - A man apparently woken from a drunken stupor by
Pierce County sheriff's deputies, repeatedly zapped with a stun gun and finally
chewed by a police dog - all in front of a production crew from the TV show
&quot;Cops&quot; - has sued the county and the officers, alleging brutality. The
deputies, accompanied by a K-9 officer from the Tacoma Police Department, were
looking for an armed suspect in a car break-in when they came upon Aaron Otto
Hansen, 34, of Roy, early on July 10, 2004.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hansen, who did not commit the crime, was passed out drunk in
a sleeping bag outside a relative's home in the Tacoma suburb of Lakewood, one
of his lawyers said. The &quot;Cops&quot; video footage of his arrest, obtained
by The Associated Press, seems to support that claim: &quot;Wake up! Show me
your hands!&quot; one officer, identified in the lawsuit as Deputy Joseph Kolp,
screams at Hansen on the video. No response. &quot;You're gonna get tased,
dude,&quot; Kolp says.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kolp pulls on the sleeping bag. Hansen - clearly disoriented
- tries to pull it back over his head, apparrently to shield his eyes from Deputy
Russell Martin's flashlight. Kolp grabs Hansen's arm and Martin moves in to help
with an arrest. Hansen, still on the ground, starts to revive. He pushes Kolp,
and the officers repeatedly use their Tasers as they kneel on him, pressing the
instruments into his chest and his buttocks. &quot;What the (expletive) are you
doing?!&quot; he moans as he struggles against them. &quot;What the hell's going
on?!&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Martin and Kolp holding him down, Hansen continued to
swing his legs, and Kolp called for help from Tacoma police K-9 officer
Christopher Karl. Karl's dog bit repeatedly at Hansen's leg, leaving his pants
shredded and his ankle bloodied. The confrontation ended after two minutes, with
Hansen in handcuffs moaning, &quot;Please, please...what did I do wrong?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;When we tell you to show us your hands, that's what you
need to do,&quot; Kolp tells him. &quot;You want to fight us, this is what
happens.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm not fighting nobody here,&quot; Hansen says,
doubled over in pain.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later that night, the officers arrested another man, John
Joyal, in the car break-in. Joyal wound up pleading guilty to a lesser crime.
Hansen was never charged in the break-in, but he was charged with two counts of
third-degree assault for resisting the officers. Those charges were dropped on
Aug. 25, the day Hansen was to be tried - the same day his lawyer first viewed
the videotape. His lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Tacoma,
names Pierce County, Kolp, Martin, Karl, the city of Lakewood and the city of
Tacoma.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of the arrest, Kolp and Martin patrolled Lakewood
for the sheriff's office. Since then, Lakewood has formed its own police
department, which is where Kolp and Martin now work. The sheriff's office, the
Lakewood Police Department and the Tacoma Police Department all declined to
comment on the lawsuit Thursday.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the video, Kolp explains the officers' actions: &quot;He
was hiding in what looked like a sleeping bag, and he wouldn't comply with our
commands,&quot; Kolp says. &quot;I went through the fence, tried to pull the
blanket back, and the fight was on. He resisted from the get-go ... ended up
kicking us, the whole nine yards. The dog was sent in to help us out because we
had two officers struggling to get this guy into custody and he wasn't
complying, so we had to take it up a notch. ... It was a full-on battle there
for a couple minutes.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of Hansen's lawyers, Philip Bolland, didn't buy that
explanation. &quot;The guy was asleep. They could have handcuffed him while he
was asleep,&quot; Bolland said. &quot;I can't think of any context where this
treatment could be considered appropriate. Anybody who sits down and watches
that tape would want an explanation.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A producer at Santa Monica, Calif.-based Langley Productions
Inc., which created &quot;Cops,&quot; said he could not confirm whether the
episode ever aired, but Lakewood Police Lt. Bret Farrar said he had seen it on
television. He declined to comment on the arrest. The lawsuit seeks damages as
well as an injunction prohibiting the police agencies from associating with
&quot;Cops&quot; or similar TV programs again.<center><b><br>

Bad news for an officer who appeared in the Boston episodes.</p>
</center>
<p>Cop charged with larceny in detail scam&nbsp;<br>
A Boston cop was charged with larceny yesterday for forging a
construction manager's signature on bogus detail cards for a site in East Boston
at which he never showed up, Suffolk District Attorney Dan Conley said. The alleged scheme netted District A-7 officer Michael
Lopriore (episodes #415, 416, 418, 421), 35, of Everett a mere $1,102, Conley said. The nine-year Boston police
veteran has not been arrested, but he will appear in court in March. Boston police officials had no comment on the case yesterday.
&quot;We are awaiting the outcome of an investigation,'' said Boston police
spokesman Dave Estrada. The allegations against Lopriore were first made last March,
when there was a complaint filed in East Boston District Court on felony larceny
charges. The basis of the complaint came from five fraudulent detail cards that
he submitted claiming he worked details for the D'Allessandro County. on Chelsea
Street.</p>

<p>Death of Deputy Featured on Cops Still Mystery<br>
Broward County, FL - The family of a retired deputy is pleading for help to
learn more about the hit and run accident that killed him last March. Michael
Hoffman (episode #104, 105, 107, 110, 112), a retired Broward County sheriff's deputy, was riding his motorcycle on
Interstate 595 when he pulled into traffic and was struck by a second
motorcyclist. The rider of the second motorcycle ditched his bike after the
collision and took off on the back of a third motorcycle. Florida Highway Patrol investigators said after the
hit-and-run, they found a receipt for a purchase of spark plugs in the abandoned
motorcycle, and traced it to a store. The surveillance tape from the store
showed two men making the purchase. Investigators said they want to talk to
those men about the circumstances surrounding Hoffman's death. Monday, Hoffman's daughter was at an FHP press conference
where she showed a segment of the television show &quot;Cops&quot; that featured
her father and asked for the public's help. If you have any information about
the hit-and-run or the two men that investigators want to question, you are
asked to call Broward County Crimestoppers at (954) 493-TIPS.</p>

<p>Cincinnati Pulls Plug on 'Cops'&nbsp;<br>
After a raucous Cincinnati City Council session on Wednesday in which several
council members demanded that Police Chief Tom Streicher stop allowing camera
crews for the Fox reality series Cops to ride along in police vehicles,
Streicher reluctantly withdrew the invitation to the show's producers, Langley
Productions, on Thursday. &quot;Personally, I think it's the loss of a golden
opportunity to showcase the police department,&quot; he told today's (Friday)
Cincinnati Inquirer. &quot;But why be in the midst of another controversy?&quot;
As reported by the newspaper, at one point Councilman Christopher Smitherman
said that no one needed to see local police &quot;hogtying&quot;
African-Americans, a remark that led an official of the Fraternal Order of
Police to reply that Cincinnati officers don't hogtie suspects and that
Smitherman should apologize for his remarks. Vice Mayor Alicia Reece commented:
&quot;I don't know if we want to put our fate in the hands of an editor in
California.&quot; Streicher told the newspaper that Cops producers were furious
about the decision, saying it was the first time that any city had ever
withdrawn an invitation. Crews had filmed in Cincinnati for two days and had
planned to remain for eight weeks.</p>

<p>&quot;Cops&quot; Celebrates Its 550th Episode<br>
Currently in its 16th season, the four-time Emmy Award-nominated series COPS
will celebrate its 550th episode, making it one of the longest-running
entertainment shows on television. The 550th episode is the first of
back-to-back &quot;War on Drugs: Special Edition&quot; episodes that feature
stings and drug dealers' bizarre behavior on Saturday, Feb. 7 (8:00-8:30 and
8:30-9:00 PM ET/PT) on FOX.</p>

<p align="center">12/27/99</p>

<p>NYC, New York - Court TV's COPS continues to be a strong performer for the
cable network devoted to crime and justice. When Court TV introduced the show to
its viewers with a 19-hour marathon over COPS Labor Day 1999, the network broke
records with a 1.6* prime time rating (non-OJ Simpson trial coverage). The
four-time Emmy-nominated series airs weeknights from 8:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m./ET
on Court TV. COPS pioneered the use of video-verite, bringing the viewer
directly into the action as it takes place without the use of scripts, actors or
narrators. John Langley is the executive producer of COPS for Barbour/Langley
Productions, Inc., which is also producing the new original series, Anatomy of
Crime for Court TV airing early in 2000.</p>
