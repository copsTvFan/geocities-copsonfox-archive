      Kelly's Gotta Habit - Al and Jefferson are on the couch at
      Al's house watching TV. Al: Boy I love Cops. Jefferson: Best show on Fox.
      Al: Like that's saying something. America's justice system at work, almost
      makes me want to pay taxes and vote. He thinks he'd make a good cop, he
      has eyes in the back of his head. Behind him Peg is tied up and getting
      robbed. Al calls the police about the robbery and asks Officer Dan if he's
      going to the strip club Saturday. He can't. Then they can't get to do
      strip searches on the girls. He knows, that stupid show Cops is following
      him around. It's Al's dream to be on Cops, he wants to ride with him. Dan
      says he works alone and lost 3 partners already. Al says all male cops
      work in pairs just like Ponch and Jon or Cagney and Lacey and asks him if
      the chief knows he rents the car out for prom dates. Dan agrees he can go
      with him. Dan comes to pick up Al. He sings Bad boys, bad boys whatcha
      gonna do when I come to see you. He's in uniform, has a gun and shoots
      himself in the leg getting ready. He gets in the car and calls Car 54
      where are you? Dan says we are car 54. The cameraman comes over, says he's
      Mike from Cops, just act natural, pretend I'm not here. Al panics. Mike
      asks him why he became a cop. It's in his blood, his pop's a cop. Mike
      gets in and asks Dan when did your partner get shot in the head? 30
      seconds from now. As a cop he's a flop. They have to do an equipment
      check. Al checks his gun and it goes off, then an owl drops from the sky.
      He's making an example. What of the last 2 spotted owls in the hemisphere?
      Al says he's seen more action in a shoe store, not that he works there,
      he's a cop and a good one. They get a call of a 633 in progress. Floor it
      danno, wait let's be careful out there. They pull up and Al gets there
      first as Dan is winded running over. The woman says it's her Stanley, he's
      going to jump. Al says we've got a jumper! Is your husband depressed? No,
      he's dead. Stanley is her cat. He became a cop to rescue cats from a tree?
      He goes to grab the cat and it jumps down on him and bites him in the
      crotch. Dan goes to get doughnuts and keeps eating a box full. Mike films
      it and asks how many can your partner eat? He's nearing his record, watch
      out his buttons are about to blow and they both duck. Mike says it's the
      worst he's filmed since Cops in Amish country. Then there is a radio call
      about Jefferson's house. Al jumps in the car and says let's go. Shouldn't
      we wait for your partner? Would you want me to wait if you were in
      trouble? You, yes. Al breaks in the door and shoots the grandfather clock,
      then the phone when it rings, then the answering machine. Jefferson and
      Marcy come down the stairs and are tied up and covered in whipped cream
      and Mike says what a sicko, they tied you up and put cream on you? They
      say uh, yes. He got away. Marcy asks Al what he's doing dressed as a cop
      and Al tasers her. Mike says this is great, going to make it on Cops.
      Jefferson says he's going to be on TV? Then he tases himself. Al chases
      the crook down and beats his head against he ground in front of his house.
      When he cuffs him the door is open and Kelly is having a party. Mike says
      nun's at an orgy, this will get him on Hard Copy. Another cop arrives and
      Marcy says there he is, arrest him. Al says that's right, got him. She
      says no, Al. He's arrested for impersonating a police officer. Marcy hopes
      he'll fry, he says back at you and tasers her as he's taken away. 10/12/96</td>
