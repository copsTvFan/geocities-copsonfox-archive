      Zone 5 - Officer R.D. Woody says midtown is the most versatile
      neighborhood in the city as far as crime and people go. He does most of
      the driving and his partner Officer Ryan Thomas likes to look a lot, sees
      a lot and is the chase man. He’s a lot quicker and can bail out fast.
      Ryan says he knows R.D. well and they can tell what each other will do in
      a situation. A man is waving a sign and is surrounded by police. He has a
      shotgun and is parked in a blue pickup with a white cap on the grass of a
      church. The lt. can’t read his sign and tells him so. The man drives
      around on the lawn and steps out with a shotgun taped around his neck.
      Major John Woodward says the man wants to talk to Art Bell on the radio,
      but he isn’t on right now. He tapes the word “help” on his door and
      runs over a sprinkler so he can drink the water. Sgt. Lance Alforn might
      go in with a taser. The man wants a bullhorn, but they make him yell to
      wear himself out. Then he tapes the word “coup” on the windshield.
      They toss in a flash grenade, taser him and break out the passenger window
      to pull him out. The ambulance will treat him and then take him to jail.
      The guy was paranoid and kept ranting about a right wing conspiracy.

      Banker has been there 3 years, has her own beat for 2 years, works alone,
      but her partner is female that covers the area. The call is at an
      apartment that’s hard to find because there are no numbers. The woman
      says her man threw her around and gets in her in trouble. They were at a
      restaurant and he wouldn’t talk and went off on her. He got out of jail
      the day before and didn’t feel like conversation. He was busted for pot
      and suspended. Debbie says he should leave, but the woman says she’ll
      leave since he won’t come back and doesn’t want him to go. He says she’s
      broke, she says whatever. He says she keeps questioning him over and over
      and he hates fighting and yelling so he leaves to give her time to simmer
      down. Atlanta Zone 3 (12:08 AM Suspicious Vehicle) Officer Jeff Glazier
      always wanted to be a cop and just wanted to be hired. He has an economics
      degree from Notre Dame. People ask him why he isn’t on Wall Street and

      Officer Jacquie Deitrich. A white car is in the grass with it’s door
      open and the headlights on. The man inside is shot in the head, covered
      with blood and DOA. The window is shot out and they close the road as a
      crime scene. There are two 9mm casings on the floor and brain matter all
      over the car. Officer Eric Minter says the bullet went right through the
      head and they’ll turn it over to homicide. #1102. 9/12/98</td>

      Officer Michael Centola says it can be humorous or dangerous. An incident
      can start dangerous, but then you can have a good time with it. Some
      things people do are off the wall, crazy. It is a good time. Sgt.

      Shell Station. She is an old, ugly, heavy, crazy white lady wearing a
      thick wool hat and heavy black eye make-up. She says she hasn't been
      drinking, just eating a Snickers bar. She ran because 10,000 sons of
      bitches chasing her tried to make 15,000 auto parts out of her. She claims
      it is her sons' car and she was in a bad neighborhood because her
      boyfriend is an addict, has a busted spleen and is half dead. She then
      starts screaming at everyone that their children are dead and you can't

      She says she was handing her the makeup bag when the cops grabbed her. The
      drug paraphernalia they find on her is because she is a diabetic. The
      crack pipe was in her purse when she got it. They drive down the road and
      see a drug deal on Edgewood Ave and run after the dealer and catch him a
      block away. He has nothing on him anymore and only ran because he was
      scared. He has a pile of money because he was scared. He ran because he

      stuff or they would kill them. The kid is cold so they take him back
      inside to get his shoes and a jacket. There is a cockatoo named Jake
      making noise inside. They are scared the men will come back, but they have
