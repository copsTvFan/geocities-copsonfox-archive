      SC
      - I remember all the beauty and bikini shots, anything that would get them
      noticed. JL - It's very flawed and full of holes looking at it now, like a
      bucket hit with a shotgun. I think it made Steve's career. He owes
      everything to me. NN - No one saw cops in this manner until now. JW - 20
      years later we are still going. JL - We got Burt Lancaster because I knew
      his daughter, I worked with Burt on a film. He was only for the pilot. The
      disclaimer was copied about 10,000 times verbatim. You are used to them
      now, but then it was real. It was lost in he heyday of drugs and it hasn't
      changed much since then. NN - It's a war, the smugglers are going to bring
      it in and we are going to fight them. These shots bring a chill to you at
      first. JL - When we first asked you to ride along what did you think? NN -
      I thought it was a great idea to be on the big screen. SC - It was so
      daring, so many said no, they might behave bad on camera. NN - I didn't
      want any deputies to become movie stars. I didn't want anything reproduced
      if we did it right, if we did it wrong show it. JL - If you didn't let us
      come we might not have made it. There was no second choice lined up. No
      Broward, no cops. Here's the funeral that continues to happen. There has
      been 10 we have filmed in the line of duty. NN - I have been to too many,
      many of my heroes are being buried, killed for no reason trying to do
      their job. JL - This is unusual, lots of objective shots, not how I wanted
      it to become, we gave concessions to you and Fox. SC - It was concessions
      to viewer conventions. JL - I thought we'll do some of this for Fox
      because that's what we are used to. JW - Don't forget it was an hour
      pilot, we were filling a lot of time not knowing what to do. JL - I always
      knew it would be half an hour, Fox didn't. I hate the way it looks, it
      looks too posed. That's a real girl, really a 911 call. A great
      establishing shot. JW - I worked for Travolta's production company. He was
      a childhood friend of mine. JL - We were filming American Vice and JW was
      chasing guys, you can't do that. I said you really should be a cop and he
      did right after. What is happening here? JW - I worked in a neighborhood
      that was loaded with drugs and I would stay around the corner and wait for
      people. There are a lot of blurs because they weren't good at releases
      then. SC - The lawyers didn't know the rules. JL - There weren't any. We
      wouldn't have these shots of him going in and coming out of the car. We
      like POV calls. Lots of news cameras didn't know how to film it. It took a
      while to convince them not to film this. JW - I stopped people in traffic
      knowing they had drugs. You never saw anything like this. Now you've seen
      it 100 times. Even the news didn't do it. JL - In 1969 they did a special
      called Law and Order (Frederick Wiseman) and I was disappointed when I saw
      it, they beat me to the punch, but I could claim ignorance. JW - The area
      I worked in was predominately black, so a white man coming in 9 times out
      of 10 was buying drugs. I took him to jail and got another. JL - This is
      the one, this is the runner. We actually missed the shot, it's a cheat.
      You see the blur, the cameraman wasn't able to get it, not trained. JW -
      He took off and ran, I had to go after him and be on the radio. JL - Here
      comes the classic line, say it. JW - That's the classic technique I use.
      He didn't turn around or stop, sometimes they hit the car. JL - If he shot
      him he would be tried for murder. He couldn't outrun him because he was
      good shape. JW - This kind of screaming is really alien to TV audience. JL
      - You didn't see that kind of raw emotion, the news didn't cover it or
      turn it into a circus. NN - This is real, if we wanted to show the public
      what it's about, this is life as a cop. JL - What's it like having a crew
      with you? JW - They rode with me for a moth, I did investigations and it
      was fun having them there. They came to my house at night and I opened my
      house to them. JL - There's Ron Cacciatore. NN - He was one of my best
      detectives. JL - He stayed with you awhile. JW - I've stayed in touch with
      him, saw him a few weeks ago. He's moved on in a different career, most of
      these guys aren't cops any more. JL - There's Dennis Gavalier and Vickie
      Cutcliff. He really loved the camera and enjoyed it at work and play. Cops
      corresponds with the popularity of crack cock cocaine, that was the big
      deal at that time. It was coming up at the time and became and invasion.
      SC - Check out the post production element, the music. JL - You'll never
      hear it on Cops again, just he pilot or 1 or 2 more. I didn't want it in
      the show, they forced it in, when I took it out they didn't notice. You
      don't hear things like that today, you are going to die. SC - How did it
      come about? NN - We had a tip from the criminals coming into Broward. JL -
      A kilo of cocaine, par for the course those days. JW - Nick was very well
      loved because he took a hard stance on drugs. JL - Look at the amount of
      cash, that was fairly common right Nick? NN - Yes, drugs, money. It was
      sad with women coming in with the babies. He made a buy of a quarter kilo
      and was so sad he pulled it out of the diaper of a baby. It had to be
      dealt with. JL - In 1988 they were doing regular stings that amounted to
      kilos and kilos of cocaine. Here comes a big crack attack, Nick loved
      those. SC - It was familiar to the TV watcher. JL - You don't see this
      much on Cops anymore, roll calls aren't interesting. JW - Ron and his wife
      at his house showing normal lives as opposed what they did for a living.
      SC - The network was very big on the soap opera aspect. JL - You guys made
      me put it in, then I just dropped it. SC - You guys? JL - Yeah, you Steve.
      This is more pure. JW - This is fun. SC - This is living room conflict, it
      harkens back to the American family. NN - He was having a good time, had
      to laugh himself when he said that. JL - It's an ongoing issue, guys want
      to watch TV, wives want to talk and go out. NN - 5 minutes later it's back
      to normal. JL - It's all true, but it looks staged. No one can me it's
      staged when you go out with the cops. Ron is still with his wife, I think
      celebrating their 30th anniversary, I think they worked out any
      differences they had. SC - It's so unusual to see the argument, people
      would argue about whose side they were on. JL - No matter what it looks
      staged. JW - It's not a normal house, it puts stress on the family. NN -
      It does make it hard on the family, but it gets in your blood, it's a
      devotion. SC - This is the best, deep in the heart of darkness. JL - It's
      video veritie, POV stuff, following them as they execute the search
      warrant. SC - In 1988 you had never seen that shot. JW - When you go
      through the door your adrenaline is pumping hard. NN - It's very
      dangerous. JW - A big rush. NN - The underworld is well armed, when you
      get in there you have to be prepared to perfection, everyone knows what
      they are doing. It has to be executed with minimum risk. SC - You must be
      stupid, I love that. JL - The typical drug bust in South Florida. The sad
      thing is the crack problem still continues, it's insidious. SC - The
      difficulty with any sheriff's department cooperating with cameras was
      landmark. JL - That's thanks to you Nick, wouldn't have happened without
      you. NN - I thought the cameras weren't interfering with the duties. They
      were very discreet, just there doing their job, they became part of their
      every day. JL - He's very good at talking to the drug suspect, working
      them as they say, trying to get more info, work the charge, as Steve says
      it was rare for it's day. JW - It's typical for the neighborhood, several
      sons over 18 living in their mom's house doing drugs. Sometimes moms would
      turn away because they brought in money. Some didn't know. They are
      finding drugs all over, then guns. The whole family gets involved and you
      could get abatement and take the house, everyone is displaced for them
      dealing drugs. NN - At the same time it destroys the family fiber, the
      neighborhood and gets the streets dirty. SC - Same logo John? JL - Yes,
      the difference between the logo then and now is now is a little color
      behind it. Remember this Steve? SC - There is beat cops, street cops,
      homicide, all different views. JL - When we first showed it there was
      something different, more horrible. SC - Yes, a gay homicide that was
      shocking. JL - It shocked me. SC - A lot ended up on the floor, especially
      that. JL - We still shoot these things, but you can be too gruesome. SC -
      Who paid for that helicopter shot? JL - It wasn't paid for, it was part of
      the sheriff's dept. There is parts of the show that only so much an
      audience could take. We blur everything it was all new territory. SC - It
      was all new, no rules for Cinéma vérité. JL - People weren't used to it
      but cops see it all the time. SC - There are segments that are not shown
      that are phenomenal. JL - There are shots that shocked this crew and they
      had to leave for a week or more. SC - This is the tamer and more
      captivating homicide segment that wasn't as bad as the other one. JL -
      This one is a floater in the bayou, it's a horrible scene on TV and
      reality, even more so in reality. You have all the attendant issues of
      homicide. Cops see them all the time, one thing to see it in real life,
      another to see it from the safety zone of the couch. Wurmsie tell us about
      that scene. JW - This is my Lt addressing roll call about the incident
      from the day before about the suspect who ran and I wound up catching.
      Like Nick said we made mistakes on camera and it was shown, if we did, it
      aired. JL - That's what we tried to do, show what law enforcement is real
      y about. JW - There I am running again. JL - We wanted to show the grit
      and reality of it all. I felt we should have a female to vary the pallet
      of cops. This is Linda Canada. JW - A girlfriend of mine I was friends
      with, she worked in a different district. JL - It was a high traffic
      prostitute area which people never saw. She was very photogenic, very
      popular, Letterman invited her on his show. Same as now if you do a show
      like this you don't have celebrities you can strut on talk shows and make
      them spokespersons. They happen to be real people not celebrities. JW - We
      wound up getting married, unfortunately it didn't work out, that's the way
      it works in police work. It's hard to have to have 2 cops in one house. We
      got divorced, I got remarried and we have a 4 year old named
      Elizabeth. This shows the home life, this is when I was first dating
      Linda, the boy Johnny is a little boy I ended up adopting and raising. SC
      - This was the attempt at soap operas. JL - To be perfectly blunt to the
      audience guys like Steve pushed for this kind of stuff, go home with the
      cops, show their home life. I insisted it was more interesting to show
      cops do their job, not cook dinner. The studio forced me to do things I
      didn't want to do. SC - Your 20/20 hindsight is so perfect. JL - I can't
      tell you how much I had to put up with producers of big stations telling
      me what to do, I didn't get it. This is something Steve can comment on
      knowledgeably, he was there. SC - With you. JL - Yes, we were standing on
      the side watching all this action. There is a famous scene coming up in a
      moment with a kid smuggling in Fort Lauderdale. Jerry you work there now?
      JW - I'm currently assigned to this airport and it has changed
      tremendously after 9/11. There is a focus on security, still have a Drug
      Interdiction Unit that Vickie was working at the time. JL - Let me
      interrupt for a Steve shot. SC - (Laughs) Talk about interrupting the
      money shot. A big drug bust and there are these 2 babies playing in the
      pool, I accommodated. JL - Let me put it this way, this is the sort of
      thing that Fox wanted. I haven't seen it in probably 15 years and it's as
      painful now as it was then. Back to the real cop show. We are standing
      watching her do her work. JW - Some of these guys meet the criteria of
      smugglers by the way they look, where they are going, one way ticket. The
      word profile isn't used. JL - Steve couldn't believe this guy smuggled
      drugs. SC - No. NN - We aren't talking about race, it's about action. JL -
      Steve said that guy wasn't carrying drugs, we are standing there and I
      said I bet you he is, $20 or whatever. SC - It's not that he was carrying,
      it's the amount. JL - He said they are harassing him and I said I bet you
      he is carrying. JW - He first denies it was his bag, now he says it's his,
      the story kept changing, so you know he's lying. Now they know they got
      him dirty. JL - He sees the camera obviously, might have been use in the
      background. Now we are circling around, game is up, he knows he's caught.
      SC - Honestly it was amazing, I never saw anything like this. JL - They
      start to cuff him and he's obviously much stronger. JW - People think it's
      easy to cuff someone, but he's a big boy. JL - He's a beast, knows he's
      caught in a big bust, he's toast. JW - This is what you call a pile on. NN
      - When police abuse is used the abuse is done on the police. JL - There is
      a delayed reaction when the cuffs come out, this was the one that
      convinced Steve and it happened right in front of him. SC - You made the
      sale, it was great. JW - He had a gun which is trafficking and a felony.
      JL - I only learned that recently. JW - This particular guy stayed in the
      crime life the whole time. He shot at cops and they shot and killed him 5
      or 6 years ago. SC - He was on national TV and it didn't stop him,
      should've been enough. NN - He should've never been on the streets. SC -
      This part was always the most emotional part of all the things about
      getting caught, he had to call his mom, as much as you don't like him you
      feel sorry for him. JL - Did the people at Fox share your feelings at the
      time? SC - I don't know, it hit on 6 different emotions, Steven Bochco
      couldn't write it. They couldn't relax enough, were too freaked out about
      what they had in their hands. NN - Here were go back to Ron &amp; Diane. JL
      - No matter how intimate it comes off, it was a genuine discussion with a
      camera, sounds, lights, I was there for all this sort of thing, She said
      enough, she didn't want us there anymore. I guess Heisenberg's principal
      of uncertainty is true, the observer affects the observed. We never went
      back to that. Besides it's not convenient and you are showing their
      families. Fox insisted on a happy ending so they got it. SC -
      Reconciliatory kiss. JL - Shakespeare in reality with the kiss. JW - They
      went through ups and downs like anyone else and they are still married. JL
      - This was perfect for the American family. SC - But not for Cops. JL -
      We've had 100s of episodes since, but no soap opera. That's not to
      disrespect Ron and his beloved wife. Here is the grand windup, the crack
      attack. This was designed to end in a big bang and bring all our
      principals back together. NN - We used to have constant meetings on how we
      would do it and avoid extra risks. We were encountering an enemy who was
      well armed. JL - This ending has all the characters, the music and news
      clips. SC - Two minutes of straight music, a nod to TV and film. JL - It
      was a nod or bow to TV conventions and to Fox. It served its' purpose, it
      was the 1 hour form. It was an excellent half hour show that ran for an
      hour. SC - It's a logical and shocking show from scripted to vérité. It
      has all the things for the screen. JL - It's a docuseries, my objections
      were that we weren't fixed on reality all the time with fictional
      techniques. SC - Like soap opera, when does it organically end? NN - In my
      opinion it led to success in all aspects of law enforcement and led to the
      recruiting of good people who would never have been interested before. JL
      - I had no idea it would go farther than the pilot. I knew it was a good
      show, no crystal ball to say we would be here 20 years. SC - John, you may
      have known the formula, and not how long it would last but I knew it would
      last as long as the 10 o'clock news would last. You kept asking me every
      year if we are getting picked up, I would always say yes you will. JL -
      That's true, Steve was always a champion of the show. SC - John was always
      a very dedicated and loyal friend even years later when I got fired from
      Fox in 1992. He kept sending to my house the rough cut of every single
      Cops show, which I thought was fantastic. JL - I always thought it was
      engaged to the producer it still startles and amazes me. You can't script
      that. NN - I would like to thank you for showing what it's all about, not
      with actors. Doing their everyday job, carrying out their duties and
      whatever it takes to keep their community safe. JL - I'm grateful for the
      opportunity to do it. I thank Steve to this day. SC - Bless you John. JL -
      Thanks to all you guys, all the people who filmed with us and all the
      cops, thank you.</td>

      Commentary</b>:&nbsp;JL - Hello, this is John Langley and I'm here with
      Bill Young former sheriff, Detective Shelia Huggins now with violent
      crimes and Sgt. Tom Jenkins now with homeland security. They were on this
      episode in Season 17 and I want to get their impressions of the series.
      This represents to me what a 1 hour episode of Cops should be. We don't
      normally do 1 hour specials, but they have their own rhythm, have music
      and interweaving. This came about from having known Bill for how long? BY
      - Too long, we hooked up in 89 when we did the episodes there, I was a
      vice cop. JL - It begins with a homicide. SH - It started first thing in
      the morning. I had info about a bartender dead in his bar, myself and my
      partner went and took off. JL - Bill did you have concerns about meddling?
      BY - We discussed it a little. We wanted you to get the material you
      needed, but to have respect about the families. JL - I remember having a
      discussion with people who worked closely with the family. SH - It's a sad
      story. He just turned 70 and two creeps killed him for 2 pool sticks. He
      was a Vegas native. JL - Extremely tragic. BY - We did it with discretion
      and still told the story that needed to be told. JL - One thing I've often
      wondered - how would you classify crime in Vegas vs. everyone else? BY -
      It's an international city and we have people doing things here they
      wouldn't do anywhere else. JL - It's the transient nature of the place. BY
      - We have 40 million tourists a year. That's a lot of people. TJ - The
      criminal element is transient, we have gangsters from LA, AZ or NY. Come
      in, commit crimes and leave, just fly back. Tourists are perfect targets
      who won't commit crime. JL - We stated with homicide then patrol. BY -
      That's out on the strip in pursuit of a stolen SUV. TJ - There is a lot of
      conversation about high speed pursuits. It's not murder, the car will
      eventually stop. BY - People can get hurt and we have a restrictive
      policy. JL - What's interesting to me is it's all one take, continuous, no
      editing one shot. Just showing what cops do. According to you he's a
      rookie. BY - He's been on 3 years. JL - To me, an army vet, he's a
      regular. Three years is still a rookie to you? SH - Oh yes. BY - With that
      hairdo he's always a rookie. JL - I said it's the style, you said not my
      department. BY - I guess I allowed it. TJ - We had him change it after
      this segment. He made a suggestion to change it. JL - It wasn't subtle. BY
      - When I started we had to wear hats, it's changed a lot. JL - The funny
      thing was our cameraman was brand new, he had been on 3 days. BY - We
      talked about how steady he was with that camera, it was a hell of a run.
      TJ - After he stepped into the bushes and gave them a little fertilizing
      JL - In other words our guy threw up after being on the job only 3 days.
      SH - I threw up on my first pursuit. JL - That's funny. BY - He did a good
      job capturing the whole thing, it's not made for TV. JL - That's right,
      people don't know what we are going to get chasing after cops who are
      chasing after suspects. TJ can you tell me what happened to these
      suspects? TJ - This guy was wanted for murder in LA and that's why he
      wouldn't stop, he had a warrant and wouldn't deal with it. Paul Gasca is a
      missing persons detective now and Gerard Bello is training. JL - We are
      back to the homicide and it's tragic, but it showed a different way of
      going back and forth to show you different aspects police work. SH - It's
      funny you should say that. It's like our job, something very serious to
      something we laugh about. BY - We go from one call to the other, sometimes
      a call comes back, that's the beauty of the show. SH - That's cops. JL -
      Did you have a good idea who the perps were? SH - At this point we have
      some good stuff, the pill bottles with names on it. People from the bar
      brought it in. We had a shoe print in the back that matched one in the
      bathroom. We had a specific shoe to look for. JL - That became a crucial
      piece of evidence in this investigation. SH - Exactly. It's one more thing
      we can look for, this is only 4 hours after the murder, that guy is
      wearing the same shoes and we want to get him right away. We had a good
      start. JL - I found this whole case fascinating because it was produced
      from the get go. SH - My partner Todd and I knew we had those pills, so we
      split up, he went to the pharmacy and I took care of the victim and the
      crime scene. We were all pretty excited and they were excited to see what
      the pills turned up. We were going for 2 days straight. We live in an era
      where people watch CSI and wonder why we can't solve these things in less
      than a day. JL - Real life is more tedious and more tragic than TV guys.
      SH - No glamour here. JL- I agree. Bill did you stay on top of the various
      homicides while sheriff? BY - Of all crimes murder is a top priority. I
      got a daily briefing from the staff about all the homicides and this one I
      watched because it was a longtime Vegas family, it was in the paper and
      was a mess. JL - We are moving on to a different segment with Gasca. It
      was very interesting because it was a stolen car call and if I recall you
      had some problems with this situation. BY - Yeah. Looking at the footage
      there was some tactical things I wasn't too happy with. You'll see here by
      the camera angle they might've set themselves up with a crossfire. There
      is a lot of issues with car stops, you'll see them point their gun drawn
      across the car with another cop on the other side also with his gun drawn,
      I wanted to make sure it looked good. TJ - It happened really quick and we
      get stolen cars all the time. To reference the sheriff's concern, these
      guys did park in a parking spot and we rolled up from the front and we
      pull them out from behind, should've gotten them from the front and we
      kinda blocked ourselves in coming from the front and back. But the way
      they came up was from the side. JL - It's in the moment. TJ - Exactly. We
      do it in the moment and straighten it up later if it goes down bad. BY -
      Sheriffs and police chiefs are the Monday morning quarterbacks sitting in
      our offices in the luxury of our ivory towers judging the cops in the heat
      of the battle, but we should just shut up and let them do their jobs. JL -
      Kind of like executive producers. BY - Yeah right, John. JL - We are the
      guys who get all the credit and do the least work. How many cars are
      stolen roughly every year in Vegas? BY - We lose 20,000 a year and that's
      a lot of cars, one of the tops in the nation. It's the transient nature,
      lots of rental cars, parking garages and the I15 corridor to Mexico.
      Unfortunately the punishment aspect isn't as high as I'd like. JL - This
      is a classic, the owner shows up to confirm it's stolen, SH - Very angry.
      JL - I can't blame him. BY - Here he comes, he's very Vegas, you had to
      cut a lot out. JL - We had to cut a lot of language or we couldn't get it
      on TV. TJ - What happened was he went into a convenience store and came
      out and the car was gone, he was close by and they caught him fast. JL -
      It's a classic cops section, I remember the guy was apologizing to them,
      he wasn't taking forgive me for an answer. SH - The bad guys are probably
      lucky the cops found them and not him. TJ - I'm sure. JL - Happy ending.
      TJ - It's a rare scene to get it back that fast, usually takes a week. BY
      - Vegas has a reputation that anything goes, but people who live there
      like me are hard on crime. JL - We go back to the murder and what's going
      on. SH - I knew the suspect had a hold of the bag and thought the pill
      bottle would lead back to the suspect, but it's never that easy. It took
      us in a different direction and this is the guy whose pills were in his
      name. I remember this really well, he rubbed me the wrong way. JL - Did
      the camera have any effect on him? SH - When we went in I asked the crew
      to hang back until I got a feeling from him. They were really good about
      it. It's delicate, have only one shot at this. I told him we had a crew
      from Cops and he didn't care. It worked out well. JL - That's why we don't
      do a lot of homicides, it is the ultimate crime and we don't want to do
      anything to screw it up. SH - I'm so mad at him, he gives an act like he
      doesn't know anything and wasn't there. All I think of is a 70 year old is
      dad. I went right over the top and Todd took over. JL - It wasn't
      intentional good cop/bad cop? SH - It wasn't. It just worked out that way.
      JL - Once we start filming and our guys blend in does it affect people? SH
      - In this case they followed me out, they got the sense he would open up
      if they went out with Todd. JL - My rule is if they start playing to the
      camera turn it off, then you become the subject. It doesn't work out all
      the time as I would like it. BY - How often do the cops play to the
      camera? JL - It's the same issue, if they start hot dogging for the camera
      I'll say either change cops or keep filming until they get over it. People
      always ask how much does the camera affect behavior. Not at all, if you
      are running out of a car and chasing the suspect you don't think about it.
      TJ - It doesn't, I've been doing it for 12 years. Once it's going you
      forget it's there. You tell them if the cameras are there things won't get
      ugly. JL - This is the robbery decoy, Bill how do you feel about it. BY -
      Sometimes you have to get innovative, it was an older section of town,
      lots of dealers and whores, figure we would catch them by playing the
      role, people don't like it, say it's entrapment, but it isn't if you
      watch. Our DA was good about it. We cleaned up the area. JL - When is it a
      sting, when does it go over the line? BY - In a lot of stings if a lot of
      cops are engaging the suspect or forcing them to commit a crime then it's
      over the line. If they are participating in a crime or forcing the
      suspect, it's rare, but that's the way it can happen. TJ - A normal
      citizen wouldn't walk by a drunk and take his money, that's the criminal
      mind, don't know how you can say that's entrapment. I walk by drunk people
      all the time and don't steal their wallet. JL - That's a good
      clarification, I don't think the average citizen gets it. BY - These guys
      are criminal opportunists and looking to steal from anyone, they deserve
      to go to jail. JL - They have the predatory impulse. BY - They are going
      after the decent citizen going down the street. JL - As a filmmaker we are
      trying to capture the truth in every detail possible. This is offbeat for
      us, we don't usually get that close to the action, but we are also filming
      with the detective up there watching it too. BY - You are undercover too.
      JL - Right. We have to go with the flow so you can see it as they see it.
      SH - Here are two interesting things - it's the same 7-11 from the last
      segment and the cops with us filmed that video for us because the owner
      couldn't retrieve it, the evidence was the Cops video. JL - I believe it
      was subpoenaed for the trail. BY - This is really good police work by TJ.
      JL - This is TJ the spotter. Take it away. TJ - I was on foot patrol and
      as I went through the buses the lady was relieving herself on the crane.
      They are on the strip out of view, but I saw them. BY - Classy lady. TJ -
      She wanted to shake my hand, but I said no the at end and you can hear me
      say not the hand you just used. I got a lot of grief for not arresting
      them and people say it was because they were good looking. But the reason
      I didn't was because they were both schoolteachers. They explained they
      were tired and have you ever really had to go bad? JL - They were leaving
      more than they were taking. TJ - They were citizens so I couldn't take
      them. SH - Where would justice be? BY - They could've walked 10 feet into
      the casino. JL - TJ with his eagle eye. TJ - If you want to see those
      things you've got be looking. You from one extreme with me and what Shelia
      was doing, we love it because it is different every day. JL - On a sadder
      note the homicide investigation goes on. Shelia? SH - The embarrassing
      thing is my partner keeps working and I'm eating down the street with my
      sgt. JL - The way it is edited no one would know. SH - I know. The citizen
      here says he heard a guy said he killed a bartender and knew where he
      stayed and flagged us down. JL - How often does that happen? SH - It's
      very rare, but this guy knew who had the pool cues and said he was sitting
      right there on the street. Todd knew we had him. Right now I'm rolling at
      100 miles an hour to catch up with this piece of the pie. JL - The guy in
      the red shirt, the witness, what ever happened to him? SH - He too is on
      that downward spiral. He was involved in a robbery turned bad where they
      killed another drug dealer and he is in prison for conspiracy with his
      part in that. JL - That's bizarre, he was a good citizen for a day. SH -
      Correct. JL - There's a very telling moment coming up and there's the tap.
      SH - Look at his arms, he was shooting up heroin, he was just festering.
      He spent the next 2-3 days in the hospital, very sick, almost died, he had
      abscesses on his arms that were clogging his blood flow because he was
      shooting up. JL - You can see his arm, how old is this kid? SH - Early
      20s. JL - That's ridiculous. SH - He is so high right now and it's sad. He
      has a family somewhere who loves him. JL - It's a stupid instance of drugs
      and homicide. BY - A lot of people don't want to listen to this, but blame
      it on drugs. After 28 years as a cop connect the dots, 75-80% of all
      crimes are linked to drugs. JL - Drugs, drugs, drugs. I agree with you. BY
      - This instance of drug use leads to a crime that makes no sense
      whatsoever. SH - Dealing with a guy like this I hate to say it, but as mad
      as I am for him murdering the bartender the guy is young, has a family,
      but his life is over now. JL - There is a telling piece of evidence coming
      up. SH - He has the pool cue with him. JL - Why isn't he cuffed now? SH -
      His arms were so bad that he was in so much pain we couldn't. He wasn't
      going anywhere. JL - There are uniformed officers behind you right? SH -
      Yes. We are all excited that he has blood from head to toe on him, but it
      was all his, he was in a knife fight the night before. BY - You can see
      this is a seedy area, not the best part of Vegas, sleazy hotel area. SH -
      You'll notice he's going to look at his shoes, the day after the murder,
      in our mind he's wearing the same shoes. Not many people can afford to
      change shoes. JL - Here's the gotcha moment. SH - It doesn't take CSI to
      match up the print in the bathroom and back of the victim. BY - This is
      real police work, it isn't made for TV, this is as close as the real world
      gets to seeing what real cops are about, that's the beauty of your show.
      JL - That's what's always been our objective and thanks to your
      cooperation we got to have the opportunity to do that. I remember telling
      you we've never had a better special. All these elements come together to
      show the length and breadth of the police department. Now we are on to a
      happier or funnier moment TJ? TJ - I was talking to the camera about
      fatalities crossing the street when I saw my friend coming out of the
      store with all this merchandize. JL - You've dealt with him before? TJ -
      Many times. BY - What's his job? TJ - He walks the streets stealing stuff.
      You can tell I'm 5'10&quot; 150, he's 6'10 190. We try to get the bottles
      because he normally throws stuff and fights. JL - Oh my god. TJ - See I
      put him on his knees because if he gets crazy I couldn't deal with him if
      he was up and fought. It looks funny and I'm smiling here, but he's a very
      bad, bad man, a very dangerous man if you catch him in the wrong spot. JL
      - The public at large doesn't get that some of these guys you know very
      well and do know what they are. Some people think you are acting mean the
      way you talk to them. TJ - Yes. He has some nasty priors out of CA, he's a
      mean freak, a week later we came to blows in that same spot. He'll mow you
      over when he's in his mode. JL - How many times have you arrested this
      guy? TJ - 15 plus. JL - 15! TJ - Over and over again. JL - That's a
      question for all of you, how often do you arrest the same people? TJ - A
      lot especially on the blvd. BY - We see the same guys. Our prisons are
      packed like sardines, we need more room. JL - Will he be back in jail? TJ
      - Not in Vegas, some of the transients will be. Look at him, he's not
      homeless, he's clean. JL - What happened with him? TJ - The next time we
      caught him he had a warrant for burglary and went to prison for a year,
      haven't seen him since. JL - Here we are coming to the wind up of the
      program and the outcome of Sheila's investigation. Tell us what's
      happening. SH - This is kinda the end. We arrested both subjects did a
      search warrant at their hotel - this is the night of day 2. JL - This is
      fast and a great outcome isn't it? SH - Yes, it went bam bam and great you
      were with us. JL - For us with the tricks and techniques of compressing
      time. We don't dictate reality, we captured it. The art of editing is
      making it look easy. About Las Vegas Heat - I hoped we could do a show
      like the way I wanted to do originally, an interweaving 1 hour format,
      with a little bit of music between the acts, not within the show, I wanted
      to show the variety of police work and I think it accomplishes that.. Just
      so you know it's one of the highest rated shows in Cops history. BY -
      That's great to hear. JL - It went through the roof. I really appreciated
      the opportunity to shoot that show and knowing you for 20 years, I hope to
      know you another 20. Watching this now we shot in over 160 cities, 5 or 6
      countries, over 2000 arrests, over 3000 officers and after all these years
      I still think we can do it better. SH - This is so great, the backpack on
      the kid had the driver's license of our victim. JL - Pretty compelling
      evidence. SH - There was a skateboard in here he stole from the guy with
      the pills that gave us the conviction. JL - Did you find the murder
      weapon? SH - We did not. It could've been anything in that bar. They
      grabbed him and bludgeoned him with it and dumped it anywhere. It's not a
      nice place down there, the bar isn't even 2 blocks from the hotel, so they
      could've dumped it anywhere. JL - What was the ultimate sentence? SH - The
      main suspect pled guilty and he's in prison serving life without parole.
      The second man was a lookout, pled guilty and he's in for 10 plus years.
      They are in for a long time and that's a good thing. BY - Absolutely. I've
      said this many times John. Your show has brought my profession to people's
      homes and they see what we really do and I think that's a good thing. I
      think the last 20 years has made cops heroic to people. They see the work
      we do and the differences we make in people's lives and that's a good
      thing. JL - I appreciate you letting us come in and film on a very
      difficult and dramatic time. Thanks.</td>

    <td width="810" align="left" height="1"><b>The Story of Cops<br>
      </b>Theme song intro w/all seasons. You can't make this sh-t up. Passaic
      river rescue #1611. Sgt. Tom TJ Jenkins - We're not actors, what you see is
      exactly how it goes. We cry when hurt, we get scared, we make mistakes,
      we're human. There isn't a script, this is the real deal. John Langley -
      how are you going to do a show with no narration, host and script? No one
      at the network cared, nobody gave a damn, nobody thought it would work. In
      my early career I did a show called Cocaine Blues which won some awards,
      it was a great learning experience for me because I got to film every type
      of crime. One cop said you want to see what it's really like? Put on a
      vest and be the third man through the door. (Baltimore, Fort Worth) I
      understood what it was like for the first time to be a cop, subjecting
      yourself to danger. I felt the adrenaline rush and I'll never forget it
      because my lower heart started thumping. That led to the notion of doing a
      show called Cops which I called Street Beat at the time. It took me a long
      time to get anyone to understand it. My partner at the time said give up
      that stupid idea, no one is going to buy it, it's not going to work
      anyway. Cocaine Blues led to doing a bunch of syndicated specials with
      Geraldo Rivera, they were very edgy at the time, about murder, runway kids
      and live drug busts across the country. Stephen Chao - I don't know
      where the tape came from, but I remember seeing this live drug bust in the
      Bahamas and it was quite a remarkable document. I said who the hell
      produced this thing/ JL - I met Stephen when I first pitched him ideas for
      shows back in 1987. He was a fresh new face at Fox and Fox was a fresh new
      face in the TV landscape. SC - When John and his partner walked in I was a
      young executive, but I had a ton of pitches in Hollywood. I thought I met
      2 really bad confidence men. John did most of the talking and he refused
      to be rattled by the ambition of the idea. JL - I knew what Cops was, I
      had a pure vision of it. Rightfully or wrongly I knew exactly what it
      should be. SC - John said we'll just take you on a ride and you'll see
      exactly what cops do. It was such an absurd notion at the time, but I was
      willing to bet him. JL - Now we had the show sold, we just had to produce
      it. There is a huge difference from producing and conceiving. So I called
      up Nick Navarro whom I worked with on American Vice back in the mid 80s. I
      said Nick we want to come down and film with you, I want to do this show
      called Cops. Nick Navarro - When John originally told me about the idea I thought it
      was crazy to get into it because I knew what criticism I was exposing
      myself to. JL - Most PD were really risk adverse, why film with anybody
      because it can only be bad news if something goes wrong. NN - We were
      really going to go through uncharted waters, I knew the chances I was
      taking. What is life without taking a chance? JL - The great thing about
      Nick was he believed in transparency, he knew the department served the public,
      he didn't give a damn and thought you should see everything. SC - The
      first thing I asked John was could you really get this all on camera? He
      did a back calculation and said he wanted 5 cameramen shooting 7 days a
      week. JL - I had a cameraman and a sound man, their duty was to ride along
      with the cops for as long as it took, following everything he did and
      capturing it all on camera. Sgt. Jerry Wurms - I had the same cameraman and
      sound man riding with me over a month. A lot of deputies were leery
      because a hot call could take place at any time. All of a sudden you were
      in a fight and wanted to portray it correctly. SC - The most interesting
      part of the show for the first half year was to see what was too shocking,
      too much, too staged, too boring. JL - Here are the mistakes I made in the
      first year of Cops, #1 I did what the network wanted me to do which was
      have music in the body of the show. #2 to follow the home life of the
      cops. Big mistake. #3 wasn't a mistake, but we did a 1 hour version, Cops
      always is, was and would be a half hour show. SC - As a producer it took the
      rest of the world to catch up. JL - One thing that was constant was I
      wanted a reggae theme song. I had everyone searching for local bands in
      Florida and someone came in with a local band and said you'll like this
      and the lyrics were thoroughly perfect - bad boys, bad boys. Ian Lewis -
      Bad
      boys is really a song about life, if you read it right, this is what's
      going to happen to you. JL - I think the audience related to it and
      accepted it the first time moment they heard it. IL - People would
      psychically recognize you on the street, you did that song. Cops promo. SC
      - All of a sudden the ratings boom took off, there was no marketing
      campaign, people just found it. In a short period of time people knew the
      pulse. JL - I would always ask if we were going to be on next year, I had
      no idea. SC - I said of course it's going to get picked up. JL - To be
      perfectly blunt the style hadn't emerged until we did 5 or 6 shows. I
      would say to the cameraman each night don't take your tripod into the
      field, wherever the cop goes, you go, whatever he sees you see. John La
      Count - When I first joined the show I was told to shoot everything, don't
      turn the camera off, roll, roll, roll. If it comes to us we'll get it.
      Douglas Waterman - The first element to the cops crew is 2 individuals, 2,
      all it is. They are producers, directors, writers rolled up into one
      because the story comes from them. JLC - You get to the station and you
      get ready, put on the microphones, the boom pole. When he gets out I try
      to get out with one hand, I've got the camera framed up, my partner is
      getting out. Sheriff Bill Young - They are connected to all these cords
      jumping out and scrambling after you and I'd think I left them in the dust
      and no, they are right there. Officer Derrick Pendergrass - They are out
      there with us scrambling for their lives just like us. JLC - It could take
      2 weeks of nothing happening then in 1 night all hell breaks loose. DW -
      That crew might've shot 10, 20, 30 hours until they got that story, it's a
      100 to 1 ratio. BY - So many times over the last 20 years this show has
      shown the working cop going out grinding on the beat and it makes a hell of
      a difference. It's changed the way American's think about cops. Sgt.
      Freddie Cruz - I remember as a kid watching an episode of cops
      specifically when it was filmed in the city of Miami. I saw a cop named
      Suarez and was quite impressed and it hooked me to the show. I thought
      I've got to be on the team. After I became a cop I went to a call and
      there he was. I said you are my hero and I had to shake his hand and to
      this day we are good friends. Sgt. Anthony Damiano - We don't go home every
      night and tell our loved ones what he do. Any time we could be shot at,
      spit at for any reason. Being on Cops showed my daughter what I did day
      in, day out. After she saw my episode she was all proud and said daddy you
      go after the bad guys. Officer Ryan Cook - The show is why I'm in Vegas
      today, it's while I'm a cop here. Cops gets you to the heart and soul of
      what police work is all about at it's best and sometimes it's worst. JL -
      I think I really knew Cops had become a success when I started watching
      parodies of it. I'll never forget being on vacation with my family and I
      went to the movies and watched There's Something about Mary and started believing
      the show was going to be around a while. Promo - beat goes on. DW -
      Everyday tapes come in from the field, every tape is logged into our
      database. I look at as many as 5 or 6 stories. Next thing I will do is look at
      all those stories and see which ones while make the best Cops segment.
      Then an editor cuts it into a segment that lasts 6-7 minutes. The ideal
      segment would have no cuts, but that's not reality. So you cut it in the
      ideal way that makes it fit. Then we work on sound editing, remove curses.
      We'll blur images where needed. There is maybe 10 seconds worth of action
      in some shows, but those are the elements that makes some shows. It's the
      emotional elements that make cops completely. There is going to be someone
      trying to get away with something or pay the price of making a terrible
      mistake. Is that person going to go free or go to jail, there is a huge
      amount of question and I think the audience gets swept away in that
      moment. SC - What's phenomenal about Cops is the amazing range of emotion
      you can hit inside of 22 minutes. It's so much more varied than what you
      get in a sitcom or drama - violence and despair, real tragedy, humor,
      happiness, emotions are always interesting and fresh, that will always be
      true. DW - When all these elements come together I will collect enough
      stories to go upstairs and show them to John. By the time the show gets to
      air I've seen each segment 6, 7, 8 times. When I see it on the air it's a
      totally different experience. For whatever reason this collaborative piece
      of work takes on it's own magic. It feels like I'm almost watching it for
      the first time. JL - We filmed with literally 100s of cops over the years
      and they've gone out of their way to be cooperative with us and I am
      eternally grateful. They are doing a difficult job under difficult
      circumstances to protect you and me, not many people are willing to do
      that. NN - 20 years ago when I met John he promised me he would show what
      cops are really like and that promise has been kept. SC - It's still as
      interesting a show as it was 20 years ago, it still is dynamic. I think
      Cops can deliver this endless parade of emotions and experiences for
      another 20 years, I have no doubt. JL - I would like to think that 100
      years from now that sociologists, psychologists and historians will look
      at Cops like a video textbook of what was going on in the 20th and 21st
      century and insights into the human behavior with little moments and
      slices of truth. If it accomplishes that I'll be pleased, that will be my
      epitaph.

    <td width="810" align="left" height="1"><b>Cops on Cops<br>
      Officer Joe Morgan </b>#1622 - Everywhere you go cops want to be on Cops,
      I always wanted to be on Cops and I had cops ride with me. It was a quiet
      day, nothing going on and Cops are in the backseat. A motorcycle came by,
      I knew it was an illegal plate, he looks at me, I look at him, then he's
      gone. Dust is kicking up and you can't see anything, suddenly the dust
      leaves and there are the tracks. I hit the brakes and thought oh no, there
      is only one thing that's going to make it worse. So then I tried pulling
      the car off the tracks and it won't come off the tracks, I can't believe
      it. I'm in trouble. All I have right now is two flat tires, if I can get
      this off I'm fine, the train hits my car I'm suspended. I didn't even know
      there was a turn, and the train turns off. What you can't understand
      watching that 6 minute piece is it took that tow truck driver 20-30
      minutes to get to me. I'm dodging trains and he can't find me. I've never
      seen so many trains in that area so quickly, it's like they are circling
      the wagons on me. To this day wherever I go - you were on cops? Yes. You
      got stuck on the railroad tracks? Yes, I did that too.&nbsp;<br>
      <b>Sgt. Harry Jackson </b>#205 - Cops captures reality of street life, the
      realities of the tough life of whores, a life people don't have to
      experience unless you are one, a pimp or a cop. This girl is 15 years old,
      I received a phone call from family members that she hadn't been home in a
      while and had been on the streets. She had drank alcohol, taken drugs, was
      on her way up in a high, as we talked to her she got higher and higher.
      She was a little stronger than normally she would be, I didn't want to
      manhandle her since she was a young person, so I called for 2 female
      officers to help me with the custody. When she started crawling up o the
      car I was thinking the best thing to do was probably drag her down, but
      keeping in mind she was a young lady and do it with as much gentleness as
      I could. With an effort to get this lady back on track I didn't want to
      arrest her, I wanted to get her back home. I wish I could say that this
      experience we had was to set her straight, but a little while later I saw
      her back on the streets, sad to say she was doing the same thing. This is
      not a glamorous life.&nbsp;<br>
      <b>Officer Ryan Cook</b> #1920 - I'm with Vegas metro, fortunate enough to
      ride with Cops. One day earlier in the shift I stopped a car, when I got
      to the front of the car my eyes almost bugged out of my head. There
      happened to be two very attractive young ladies that happened to be
      wearing bikinis. After I gathered my thoughts I tried to plug away
      professionally and do everything by the numbers as they taught me to do.
      You never know what you are going to get on the street. It turned out to
      be a very, very interesting stop.&nbsp;<br>
      <b>Officer Derrick Pendergrass</b> #1830 - I've been watching Cops ever
      since I was a kid and it's amazing what the camera can capture as far as
      what we deal with as cops. At that time I was thinking medical, what can I
      do to get this person help so they are OK. You come in with one mindset,
      then it switches over to something you weren't prepared to encounter. I'm
      trying to find out what's going on, how she was injured knowing she was
      highly drunk and that it's hard for her to comprehend what happened to her
      and put it into words so I can help her out. Doo doo - that's my new
      nickname pretty much now. She's trying to be the cop and control the
      conversation with me, and I'm trying to control the conversation and be a
      police officer. It was still an issue of her safety, trying to keep her
      calm, didn't want her to stand up so she didn't fall and get hurt. Looking
      back at it I was furious, I was trying to keep the woman safe and she was
      trying to bite my arm. But there is sympathy that she was drunk and didn't
      know what she was doing. I'm completely satisfied with the way I handled
      the situation, I would do it again the same way. At the end of the day I'm
      going to go home safe and the people I work with are gong to go home the
      same way.&nbsp;<br>
      <b>Deputy Belinda Mangum-Lorenz</b> #1818 - I had cops ride with me. The
      very last day was one of the most fun calls that I had. It was a traffic
      stop on a suspicious vehicle, these guys from the moment I walked up were
      trying to hide things and lie to me. What you don't see is when I walk up
      I see the driver brushing the pot off his shirt and the car reeks of dope.
      Of course every other person in the car has to lie that they didn't see
      nothing, didn't know nothing, always he same. They lie to your face. What
      you have to deal with every day is you have to see through it to know what
      we are dealing with.&nbsp;<br>
      <b>Sgt. Anthony Damiano</b> #1605 - one of the good things about Cops is
      it's reality TV, but on the streets it's hard to tell between reality and
      fiction. I knew the guy was full of it from the minute he came out of the
      vehicle and said he was working, it was 10 o'clock at night, he wasn't
      getting out of work. What you have to do is figure out the story, have to
      separate them, talk to the girl, to the guy, see if their stories match. I
      was trying to play them against each other and it worked. They are always
      out there to try to trick you because no one wants to go to jail, they
      want to do their crime and get away with it.&nbsp;<br>
      <b>Capt Joseph Lombardo</b> #340 - I am currently assigned to Homeland
      Security. People always ask if the experiences make you hard. 20 years ago
      I was on the street as a young narcotics cop. I show up and there is this
      woman in the street yelling and screaming. I don't know what the hell is
      wrong with her. The most disturbing thing about the whole episode was
      after she was jailed a neighbor called and said what about the kids? This
      lady was whacked out on drugs and had 2 kids at home. I thought oh my god
      how could she do that with two small kids? They don't teach you that in
      the academy about life. After a while it just hardens you and you show up,
      go through your business just like every other call.<br>
      <b>Officer Rob Boothe</b> #1620 - one of the great tings about Cops is not
      only does it focus on the action, but some of the psychological aspects
      people don't see. What I'm seeing is the suspect exits the vehicle and his
      eyes are pretty large and he's under the influence of some mind altering
      substance. Knowing that how we prevent ourselves to him will show how the
      situation goes. You can feel the tension in his forearms and shoulders,
      his eyes go from half closed to focused, there are all the signs that the
      suspect is going to be hostile. It's inevitable that this will end in some
      kind of use of force. The only thought is what's the best way to keep
      myself safe, my partner safe and the suspect safe while maintaining a
      sense of control. The taser had just been introduced to our department and
      it was the perfect situation, the suspect doesn't get hurt and it worked
      flawlessly. So here's our suspect that goes on and on that he's been hit,
      stabbed, socked in the jaw, can take care of himself and nothing hurt more
      than that taser. You think he learned, it would be a landmark event in his
      life. He's been arrested many times since then, has been tased multiple
      times and not only does crime not pay, it doesn't think as well.&nbsp;<br>
      <b>Deputy Casey Jacobson</b> #1228 - when Cops came to Albuquerque I
      figured I wasn't gong to be part of the show because I worked in the North
      Valley which is a quieter part of Bernallilo County. It doesn't have a
      high volume of calls especially on graveyard hours which was the shift I
      was working. The incident I was in was in the city limits and involved a
      chase of a silver Camero they weren't able to catch. He was firing a
      weapon out of the car. It came into our county, came over our air and they
      asked for assistance if anyone could do a PIT maneuver. One cop said Casey
      could do it and is certified, so I got volunteered. I thought oh crap, I
      have to do this and I can't screw it up. I was 3 months out of the academy
      and was barely comfortable doing the everyday normal stuff like tickets
      and reports, let alone a high intensity type incident. Thankfully I had
      enough sense to look around at my surroundings, they hadn't had the road
      blocked totally off. I was attempting to do the PIT and saw oncoming
      lights, the adrenaline was pumping, I was nervous and scared and had to
      get right up next to the car. The PIT I did slowed the suspect down and we
      were able to do another PIT to stop the car. It came out good, we got our
      guy. I wanted to do it again, after that one it was fun, but I know you
      can't just go out and PIT every vehicle that you want to stop.&nbsp;<br>
      <b>Sgt. Tom Jenkins </b>#1813 - I'm with the Vegas PD, have been rolling
      with the crew almost 12 years, even the gangsters I deal with have seen
      the show. I happened to get a call on a dangerous suspect fighting with a
      subject in a restaurant. What people don't know is before I got there the
      suspect had torn a McDonald's apart. As we were driving there I am
      assuming he was in the business, but the crew spotted him walking and if
      they hadn't been there I might've missed him and he would've destroyed
      another business. When I walked up he called out some racial slurs and I
      knew he wasn't going to be cooperative. I asked him to take his hands out
      of his pockets and he refused. As you can tell it's a quick decision for
      us and we have to use force. It was one of those ask, tell, then make. It
      got to the point I had to make him take his hands out, he put himself in
      that predicament and that's how we got to that conclusion. It got me a
      little respect from the gangsters who I deal now who think if they don't
      listen to me they are going to get that maneuver I did on this guy. It's
      been good, mostly good, it's made me famous and infamous all at the same
      time, you realize how much impact the show has and how many people it
      reaches. (31 mins)</td>
